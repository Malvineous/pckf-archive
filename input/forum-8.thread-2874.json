[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  Basically, it's a redirect bug which allows people to fool gullible users into believing their site is actually part of ezboard.com.

Signature files that stretched tables and auto-linked people to porn sites, ways to edit other peoples' messages, huge scrolling banner sigs... it was ugly.  Very ugly... EzBoard's full of holes.  Please be gentle with it!<br /><br />--Xky"
