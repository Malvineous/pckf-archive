You only use tables in HTML as you would in a business document - to lay out tabular data (for example, to lay out a list of countries and some statistics about them you would use tables).<br /><br />Also, avoid using &lt;<i></i>img<i></i>&gt; tags for your layout - use them to includes art, pictures, screenshots etc. but not for things like the edges of the text box or that keycard in the bottom. (This might sound crazy, but you'll find it is really much better using CSS for these things)<br /><br />Some useful links include [url=http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/]Listamatic[/url] (for that navigation) and [url=http://www.alistapart.com]A List Apart[/url]. It takes quite a long time to learn to use CSS, but you'll regret not doing so in the future.[url=http://www.toxicsheep.com]www.toxicsheep.com[/url]<br />[img]http://www.toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobblersig.php[/img]"

It's almost impossible to browse a table-based site with a screen reading, and future browsers will not display table-based sites correctly. Also, CSS-based sites are viewable on devices with small screens - table-based layouts are either unreadable or very painful to read. If you don't care about any of these points, then that's fine - but you might regret it later.[url=http://www.toxicsheep.com]www.toxicsheep.com[/url]<br />[img]http://www.toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobblersig.php[/img]"
