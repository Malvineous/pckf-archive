		"content": "originally my Keen and Sonic crossover fan fic series Dimension Chaos started out was actually planned to be a lucasarts styled adventure game. I then turned it into a fic because 1)too much action to be used as a adventure game and 2) I suck at learning AGS. Besides I feel its better off being a fan fic and the story has grown so much since then spawning the series to be turned into a 5 part series. Still I do have an idea for a plot for a original Keen adventure game thats a prequel to the first game that tells the story of how Billy actually became Keen. I'd love expand this plot and put it in a fan game. The end is near. An evil force returns. And only Commander Keen can stop him, but this time he must team up with a super sonic hedgehog and a two tailed fox.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  Would be interesting as fan fiction as well (or as anything)..<br /><br />As well, I don't personally prefer games that are just slapped up with quickly and badly made graphics. Nothing's wrong with Paint made graphics (see XkyKeen1-3), but often when someone that can't draw uses Paint (or any other program) the graphics suck. I don't want to see quickly made crap in Keen fan games..<b>You hear in your mind: GAAARRRRRGG!</b>"
