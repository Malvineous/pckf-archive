(I.e bloog and blooglet, life and lieflike)[hr][/quote]<br /><br />-je is a Dutch innovation to say that an object is small it can only be connected with a noun. The Dutch word for small can also be used the same way as in English and even in combination without changing the meaning. Sometimes, probably for pronunciation matters, a t is added to the suffix and sometimes the root of the noun is made longer.<br /><br />Examples: E-D<br />meisje - little girl<br />klokje - little clock<br />kleine klok - little clock<br />klein meisjes - little girl<br />koninginnetje (koningin) - little queen<br />gitaartje (gitaar)  little guitar<br /><br />-like is a little bit harder to explain it's a suffix that can make a noun an adjective. <br />example: gevaar (danger) ---.&gt; gevaarlijke man (dangerous man). It can also be connected with the predicate.<br />example: rijkelijk belonen (to reward generously)<br />Sometimes the adjective has little to with the root.<br />example: achter means behind while achterlijk means ridiculous. <br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Also, what does 'tjakka' mean? [hr][/quote]<br />Tjakka is word made up by someone who's name should not be spoken. The best word I can think of to compare it with is 'yeah' or maybe better 'hell yeah'. It's a word to express enthousiasme.<br /><br />-----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Falling.gif[/img]"
