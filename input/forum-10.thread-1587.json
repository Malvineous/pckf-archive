For those of you who have read Phillip Paulman's series, the same people who directed Lord of the Rings is bringing you The Golden Compass. One thing I liked was in the trailer the first song was \"Mars : The Bringer of War\" - If that titles right, ah well. You know what I mean.<br /><br />             Discuss.<br /><br />EDIT: BTW, more on the movie at [url=http://goldencompassmovie.com]goldencompassmovie.com[/url]"
