Providing you can stream digital audio out the speakers on the fly, that'll let you play IMF files.<br /><br /><i>Seriously though, getting instruments from an Adlib file shouldn't be this hard?</i><br /><br />The problem is that IMF files don't technically store the instruments.  If you're working with MODs then you'll be thinking of a dedicated section of the file for instruments/samples, and then when you play a note you select which instrument to use.  IMF works at a much lower level, it only stores all the values sent to the OPL chip on the sound card, and when you stream these values one at a time back to the card, music comes out.<br /><br />If you want to find out which instrument is being used, you have to work your way through the file and check every byte being sent out, to see whether it's related to setting the instrument - I can't remember the numbers exactly, but basically data sent to register 0x60 sets one tiny part of the instrument, register 0x80 sets something else, but register 0xB0 actually plays a note.  You'll have to gather up all the values for the instrument registers, then write them out in a known format.  The problem is that there's nothing stopping a song from playing notes in between setting instruments, or twiddling with the instrument settings while the song is playing, in effect using thousands of slightly different instruments.  In practice this rarely happens, but it's something any converter would have to handle.<br /><br />I have thought of another way of getting the instruments out - if you can find that IMF2MID program I posted about years ago, run that on the IMF file.  It will print all the port settings for each instrument to the screen, so all you have to do then is write down those values and save them in a certain format.  Look up the .IBK (Instrument Bank) format, that stores a whole bunch of Adlib instruments, and if you can convert IMF2MID's output into an .IBK file then you can load it in SBTimbre and use that to play single notes.  You'll want to be at least a little familiar with how the OPL chips work to do that successfully though."

I like every improvement they made for this version, and since it's now for free... (yeah, no evaluation period, but some functions that professionals enjoy are not present in these editions).<br /><br />And the program I'm developing uses Allegro, too (thanks to this topic!).<br />[hr][img]http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/983/vegetableswk2.gif[/img]"
