I've been using the admin-esque powers you gave me (for reasons unknown to me) to give them the axe.<br /><br />As far as I know, nobody even reads those forums anymore, but I wanted to bring it to your attention because it seems there's at least 3 posts a week advertising some sort of scam."

I'm out of town now but I'll try and deal with this when I get back.
