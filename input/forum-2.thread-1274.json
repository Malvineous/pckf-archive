		"content": "Whoa! so many keen games planned. I hope you guys didn't forget about Super Keen Fighter 4. Anyway I took all of your comments about the last demo and improved the game. The game now has much better graphics and is not so pixelated. Each character is being redone to include much better A.I. and we are changing fonts and tweaking the engine some more. Expect another demo to be released soon or the game soon. you may visit the SKF4 site:<br /><br />[url=http://www.spatang.com/nickssoftware/skf4.htm]Here.[/url]<br /><br />When a new demo comes out with these features i will tell you all.<br /><br />BTW do you guys care that [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lindsey.gif[/img]  is out of the game? just wondering[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-spotkeen.gif[/img]"
