But graphics will be much better (one tile has size 32*32 and many colors instead of 16). Also i think that Windows clones of Keens 4-6 will have one executable, but different DLL's with description of enemies, because it seems that Keens 4-6 engines are almost identical except to enemies. (There are some tile properties which exist only in one episode of keen, but i think that this Keen for Windows executable will support them all, as far as common tile properties). So the maker of New Keens 4-6 will need only one game engine, what will make his work much easier. Also i think that this remake will support some new features, which don't exist in DOS keens, for example combining of all these episodes into one big episode, which conains all objects from all episodes and very interesting levels (which contains objects from different episodes) will be possible then. Also i hope that:<br /> it will be easy to make completely new episodes with new objects: just desciption of enemies, tile properties and new graphics will be neesed<br /> amount of save games will be unlimited<br /> saving of half-recorded demos will be possible<br /> demos will be recorded in the memory during each play of game and special demo-recording command won't be needed anymore (see New Supaplex, [url=http://www.newsupaplex.pp.ru/index_eng.html]www.newsupaplex.pp.ru/index_eng.html[/url] )<br /> Gamespeed will variable and not fixed (also see New Supaplex)<br />and etc...<br /><br />But nobody is going to make it.
