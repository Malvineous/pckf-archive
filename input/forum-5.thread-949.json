Many of the Vortininjas are located in a way that makes Ankh use strategic (and necessary) to complete the level.  Skypests, on the other hand, are often placed in such a way that the player needs to completely halt their progress or risk certain death (hello Pyramid of the Forbidden)...<br /><br />Sometimes a simple enemy will be placed in a hard location, like the Fleex before the exit to BASA on Hard mode (I think it was BASA--but might be Guard Post III).  Other times an enemy can be a cakewalk because it's put in a location which doesn't matter (the Spirogrip in the Gravitational Dampening Hub) or is hard to get to.<br /><br />I think, in the long run, Meeps are the single enemy I loathe the most simply because of what happens when they walk off a cliff.  The noise, the spamming of deadly shots, and the complete inability to defend against it... it's just not fair."
