		"content": "You can order MANY pogosticks online. Besides that... they are actually quite common. Pogosticks are labled as \"toys\" so you will probably have to suffer the indignity of browsing the isle that also has the \"Power Rangers Thunderclap Stomp Sword.\"<br /><br />Your best bet would be to look in all the big superstores first. (Boscovs, Sears, etc.) If you can't find one there, you might want to try specialized kids stores like Toys R Us. (For which you would pay $67 USD for a lego set that consists of 20 pieces... But I digress.)<br /><br />Or you can get one where my parents did. I think they found it in a house they cleaned out in Lancaster city once... It was real rusty and didn't bounce well.-----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."
