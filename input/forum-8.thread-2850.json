Give me an insight into your strange, warped dystopia, where the world we live in is simply a facade for death, corruption and destruction wreaked by politicians. I agree there is a certain degree of evil (that seems to sum up those few words nicely) but it appears that you have become slightly too obsessed with the notion that reality, politics and the media are all an illusion.[hr][/quote]<br />(It's a pity this discussion did not remain as peaceful as the \"Oh, Human Rabbits\" topic. . . oh well.  I apologize for my condescending speech in my last post -- it did come across rather rude, I'm afraid.)<br /><br />You have it wrong:  I don't live in a \"strange, warped dystopia.\"  There's not really any \"insight\" to give you.  Basically all I'm saying is this:  if you see a news report (bbc, cnn, etc.) you can<br />(1) read it, take it pretty much as fact (just ignore possible flaws and unanswered questions) and believe it<br />or<br />(2) read it, question it reasonably, wait for further reports, and if they don't stand to reason, discard them (this should then make you automatically aware that not everything you read or hear in the news is true)<br /><br />For example, here are two questions concerning the fairly recent tsunami of December 26, 2004:<br />(1)If \"over 100 years of accumulated stress was released in the second biggest earthquake in recorded history,\" why was their another large quake in March?  The stress built up real fast, I suppose?<br />(2)Since \"the lower plate, carrying India, is being forced or subducted beneath the upper plate, carrying most of South-East Asia,\" there really wouldn't be any water displaced.  For the type of tsunami that happened, an awful lot of water had to by displaced.  How does that work?<br />BTW, these quotes come from [url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4381395.stm]BBC[/url].<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<i>grafix asked:</i><br />Also, who do you think is more likely to brainwash you with propaganda and lies: the right-wing church or the scientists? Discuss. (I say the church - you'll probably say the scientists. As a result, this argument will continue indefinetly. Yay!)[hr][/quote]<br />Neither one is more likely. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img]   I don't think their teachings are very comparable (but I guess I wouldn't know).  They'll both \"brainwash you with propaganda and lies.\"<br /><br />Finally,<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<i>grafix:</i><br />Anyway, I don't see much point in continuing to argue so I refuse to argue unless GMixer comes up with something really good[hr][/quote]<br />You haven't defined what something really good would be, but if all you want to do is flame someone, I agree:  the discussion might as well end.

The only things I seem to miss are stories about car accidents, random deaths, and sensationalised events which are somehow deemed important despite being only one of countless identical scenarios that take place every day (Shane Warne splits with his wife... wtf? Why should I friggin' care!?)<br /><br />I prefer to keep myself informed about things that are going to improve my life or give me some sort of useful knowledge, not keep me in some sort of stale contemplation about other people's lives. Nexus and New Dawn magazines (and occasionally a couple of computer magazines, though I mostly keep myself informed about such information through friends and the Internet) are my mainstay of published reading. Then there are places like [url=http://www.red-ice.net/]red-ice.net[/url] (which I only found recently). There are a few others, but I haven't been keeping up with much news on any front for a few months so I don't remember them off the top of my head.<br /><br />Before you start telling me to take this sort of reading material with a grain of salt and not to believe everything I read, let me tell you that I do my research before allowing anything to integrate into my belief system. There are some things I 'want to believe', but I'm careful not to opinionate myself about them without being sufficiently convinced.<br /><br />And with that said, I send back the same words: take what you read in the mainstream media with a serving of NaCl, and realise that there are many powerplays and undercurrents going on behind the scenes and agendas with strong interests in keeping the masses ignorant of that very fact.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Grafix</b> Otherwise, you've swayed too far into the realm of conspiracy theories and other stupid, overly paranoid ideas.<br />[hr]Consider back in the day when Hitler was taking power... I wonder how many people considered criticism toward Nazism 'paranoid' and 'stupid'... and look today at how many consider criticism toward Bush and his police-statesque policies similarly unfounded, and ignore the implications of things like [url=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/june2005/140605presidentforlife.htm]this[/url]. <br /><br />I find it intriguing that Clinton was nearly impeached for an affair which he came clean about a very short time afterwards, yet Bush, Blair and Howard are still in charge of three large chunks of the Western world after their blatant lies that we've put up with for almost four years.<br /><br />Honestly, in ten years I hope it's the people who oppose my view saying, \"See, there was nothing to worry about--you were just paranoid.\" But in the meantime, I place my trust in people who are interested in expanding our understanding of the world rather than keep our minds enslaved to the status quo.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Grafix</b> OK then, tell me what is really happening.<br />[hr]This: billionaires want to remain rich and the 'ruling elite' (the puppeteers behind world events) want to push their agendas. Anything that threatens their money and power--industrialised use of hemp (logging, tobacco, oil industries), mass-produced alternative energy sources (oil industry) and natural therapies (pharmaceutical, sickness industries), for example--or gives the people the freedom to question their authority must be bankrupted, suppressed and crushed through any means possible.<br /><br />Of course, there are many good things happening; people are waking up just as much as others are falling asleep (changing the brightness looks horrible without also changing the contrast). We're becoming more technologically and spiritually advanced by the day, possibilities that once were scarcely dreamt of are appearing every hour, and while the Unified Theory of Everything and the Meaning of Life yet elude us, we are finding answers to many things we once thought unanswerable.<br /><br />That's the gist of what's happening.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Grafix</b> Also, who do you think is more likely to brainwash you with propaganda and lies: the right-wing church or the scientists? Discuss. (I say the church - you'll probably say the scientists. As a result, this argument will continue indefinetly. Yay!)<br />[hr]As GMixer established, both are as bad as one anther on their own. I will not believe something just because the church says it's so, nor because science says it's so. Both have part of the truth, but their knowledge is worthless without the part that the other has, as is the case with the left- and right-wing in general.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Grafix</b> I still think you're a bit too paranoid (some paranoia is good - it keeps us going) but you're probably winning this argument because I made several blunders and was rude on a few occasions. I'll apologize again, and maybe we can drop this rather irrelevant argument that I started.<br />[hr]Please, keep arguing if you feel the need. If I'm wrong about something, or if you find something I've said questionable, I want to know. Discernment can be a difficult process, especially with the volume of contradictory information scattered across the Internet, and we're all liable to form fallacious beliefs and ignore certain evidence that may be blatantly obvious to others.<br /><br />Before I end this post, I want to add something to the original substance of this thread.<br /><br />Recently, my cousin (the same M who was in Spleen's Saga that I posted some time ago, for what it's worth) won back custody of her son (who had been living it up with his grandmother and the rest of her rather large, yet stable family), on the basis that 'the child is better off with his mother'.<br /><br />He's already been through much trauma at the hands of M's spouse (the 'dark room' used as a means of punishment, where he's sent sometimes for a whole day)... combine that with M's drug-dependencies and such, and alarm bells should start ringing. But somehow self-righteous authorities think their macro vision causes this evidence to become irrelevant.<br /><br />And then there's another custody issue regarding my mother's boyfriend's son. The mother is... well, weird. For anyone who knows her in person (for the record, I don't), she should not be to given the full custody she's after, if any. Yet when interviewed or inspected (for which there is enough warning given for any fool to put up a sufficient faade) she passes with flying colours and somehow comes out sounding the more credible party.<br /><br />These anecdotes are not as extreme as the one Grafix originally posted, but they're similarly abominable miscarriages of justice.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />\"This is how liberty dies--with thunderous applause.\" -Padme<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
