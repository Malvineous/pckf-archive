The game is basicly like asteroids but if it had add. I've only got up to level 21. See if you can beat me  [hr][/quote]<br /><br />Harvey wrote:<br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]This is fun!<br /><br />[url=http://www.praize.com/Games/Log_runner/]Log runner[/url]<br /><br />REVIEW<br /><br />ART 9/10<br />The art is good. The only problem with it is that some of the graphics look a little strange. Other than that the art is perfect!<br /><br />Gameplay 9/10<br />The gameplay is fun. You walk across the logs, bringing items from the opposite side to the side you start on to to get points and going to the water fall to go to the next level. If you fall in the water or a bear catches you, you lose a life. Sometimes you might fall trough a log into the water but that's all for the bugs.<br /><br />Audio 8/10<br />The sound is good. I thought the \"fell in water\" sound was a little strange, but it is okay. There is no music in the game. Yes, you do hear the lumberjack humming at the title screen, but I don't think that's music.<br /><br />Content 10/10<br />There is no bad content in this game.<br /><br />Story 1/10<br />You play as a lumberjack. That's all for the story. Of course, you don't need a story for this kind of game. You can make up a story too, like \"A lumberjack has to get food for his family, but there isn't a grocery store where he lives, so he just has to find some that was placed on the other side of the river for some unknown reason\".<br /><br />Overall 45/50=9/10<br />-1 for odd looking bear<br />-1 for a programming error that makes it so you can fall through logs into the water<br />-1 for strange \"fell in water\" sound<br />-1 for NO music what-so-ever<br />-1 for no story [hr][/quote]<br /><br />And also pointed this game out:<br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]This is a fun game!<br /><br />[url=http://www.flashplayer.com/games/streetsoffire_movie.php#bottom]Streets of fire[/url]<br /><br />GOAL<br /><br />You are a flame, and you run around burning down buildings. Burn buildings to get 1234 points. If you run out of fuel, you lose the game. Grab the canisters to get more fuel. You get a bonus for burning all the buildings in an area. [hr][/quote]<br /><br />Some funny cursor thieves also discover by Harvey(no games)<br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]This is funny! <br /><br />[url=http://gprime.net/flash.php/cursorthief]Thief 1[/url]<br /><br />There are also differentversions of it.<br /><br />Cursor Thief Live<br /><br />[url=http://www.flashplayer.com/games/cursorthieflive_movie.php#bottom]Thief 2[/url]<br /><br />I'm sure there are more types of Cursor Thief, too!
