		"content": "Just watched a repeat of G4tv.com. A show on G4 thats basicly like an interactive show where viewers can call in and ask questions and voice their opinions on games and stuff. In last weeks episode they had some of the guys from ID software come up and talk about their latest work like Quake 4, The doom movie and their upcoming new wolfinstine game. When one of the questions that was asked by a fan was concerning whether Commander Keen would make a comeback they basicly responded that he's probably not coming back since the doom guy killed him in doom 2 (damn you easter eggs! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-annoyed.gif[/img]:\"&gt;  ). But the important thing was that Carmack mentioned that he did want to release the source code like their previous games but was unable to find them and acknowloges that there are alot of Keen fans out there. Well at least they are noticing us [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img] Check out my blog at [url=http://spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/]spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/[/url]<br />Check out my fanfics at [url=http://www.fanfiction.net/u/680124/]fanfiction.net[/url]"

I don't think the GBA game sold particularly well, not helping them wanting to keep the rights either.<br />At least that way we should see some new, official, Tom Hall, Keen games.<br /><br />Of course some good programmers fooling around with the source code to enhance those games isn't too bad either; I like playing Doom, DN3D, and SW on my relatively new computer with OpenGL and everything as well.Retodon8<br />You live, you die, you are remembered, you are forgotten.
