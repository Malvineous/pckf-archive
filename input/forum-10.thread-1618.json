Asshole.  Major Phillip Asshole.<br />*Dark Helmet ponders this for a moment*<br />...How many Assholes we got on this ship?<br />*many of the soldiers working on the bridge rise and salute*<br />SIR!<br />*Dark Helmet is shocked*<br />I knew it!  I'm surrounded by Assholes!<br />*Dark Helmet pulls his mask down, which deepens his voice*<br />Keep firing, Assholes!<br /><br />:-)  I know I didn't get it word-for-word, but that is by far my favorite extended gag in a movie.  <br /><br />Spaceballs was the only movie I had in the house one summer I was staying at my dad's house... I think we watched it every day for two months.  :-(  I can't watch it anymore."
