		"content": "Well, for the past few years we've managed to hide our little charade from pretty much everyone, but recently Grafix got disturbingly close to the truth, and its only a matter of time before he finds out and tells everyone.<br /><br />Me and Gal are posting this to admit to a huge deception we've been hiding from all of you, and others at other times. <br /><br />I am not a girl, nor do I live in New Zealand; I'm using a program to fake my IP adress, origionally to sneak into a forum I was bugging. [The admins may have noticed I was apparently i Australia for a month in november of last year] Gal, who has always acted rather feminine, has a reason; 'he' is a girl, and is actually the girl you've seen in pictures of 'me'<br /><br />Gal and I live not more than a few streets away from each other and have known each other for quite a while; we both attend the same school and are the same age. We have been dating for about a year now. The fuzz faced person in 'my' pictures is Gals older brother, who is also in on this little charade, mostly as an amused observer.<br /><br />Origionally this was supposed to be a small gag, a joke played on a few people, but then I signed up here, and so did she, and by then it was too late to admit anything and thats how we got to where we are today.<br /><br />As a recap, here's my picture. [Yes, my webcam sucks, so sue me]<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/yesitsme.png[/img]<br /><br />This should come as no news to Xky who has always known that I am actually male.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img] <br /><br />Anyways, I think Galaxieretter's reply seems a bit I-pretend-that-this-is-true-but-subtly-hint-the-reader-that-I'm-joking. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />First I thought LL was a guy, since she joined Keen: Modding (I mentally assumed that there are only males there) before joining here (IIRC). After she told somewhere there or here that she's she the image naturally changed a bit in my mind..<br /><br />If this is true as the topic claims, then it's very awesomely made prank. But if so, we lose the legend of a female Keener that has produced several mods..

I don't remember where it was but there was a post for zy 15th birthday z posted at K:M. Works for the Simpsons, but not IRL (though somehow overlooked in the virtual world).<br /><br />2) Zy interest in US politics and such. Sure, I was into that for a while when there was a chance the current dictator could be removed, but I never made a mod about it...<br /><br />3) Zy (alleged) uncanny resemblance to Princess Lindsey...<br /><br />4) Well, za.<br /><br />Galaxie, though... z seems more real now under the guise of a female, but there's nothing in particular that made za seem either masculine or feminine.<br /><br />But z did always seem somehow more knowing of LevelLord's happenings, especially when z was away for a week or so after zy room flooded and such--I always just passed that off with the explanation that they talk on MSN alot, but it still doesn't explain it all (especially since Gal doesn't seem too comfortable chatting with people z looks up to, and LL should definitely be one of those).<br /><br />However, that said, as for KeenRush and Grafix, something still doesn't smell right. LL seems to have an undecided personality online. It was only today that z seemed particularly Levish with zy spelling and all, and spoke as if z hadn't spoken with me for some time. Perhaps z really <i>is</i> six different people.<br /><br />It doesn't matter either way, of course.
