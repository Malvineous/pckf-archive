You start at 5 years old and do your SATs (Standardised Assesment Tests) in Year 2 (because it starts at Reception/Year 0).<br /> * 4 years of junior (upper primary) school. You start at 7 years old and do your SATs again in Year 6.<br /> * 3 years of lower secondary school. You start at 11 and do your SATs yet again in Year 9.<br /> * 2 years of upper secondary school. You do GSCEs in upper secondary, so exams and coursework are spread out over the two years.<br /><br />At that point, you are free to leave and get a job - but at this point you're only well qualified enough to do minimum wage work such as working at McDonalds. If you want to get a proper job, you need to go to sixth-form college (two years) and university.[url=http://www.toxicsheep.com]www.toxicsheep.com[/url]<br />[img]http://www.toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobblersig.php[/img]"

And that includes making room for England and Ireland.<br /><br /><b>New Zealand vs. Australia:</b> Australias neighbour New Zealand is about the same size as England or Japan. Hence, Australia is about 20 times the size of New Zealand which has a population of 3+ million compared to Australias 20 million. However, New Zealand has the same number of sheep as people! Australian sheep have more space to roam.<br />[hr][/quote]But you missed my original point - I wasn't saying that mentioning a state is bad, I was just saying that Americans assume the rest of the world knows all its states.  Instead of saying \"I live in Wisconson, America\" you just say \"I live in Wisconson\" leaving the less geographically knowledgable of us to continue wondering which country you're from.<br /><br />Oh, and KR: I agree that starting school at five years old isn't always the best.  Because of where my birthday sits, I started when I had just turned five - most people start when they're a few months away from being six, so I was effectively a year younger than everyone else.  I did tend to find some of the work a bit harder to grasp because of that, I think I would've received better grades if I started a year later so from that point starting at seven years old is probably much better (as is the usual case in Europe.)  However starting when you're five has its perks - even in Australia not many other people have a full time job and can afford to buy their own house when they're 20 years old...

It's about as sprawly as Melbourne... less ugly, and not as busy, with a comfortable amount of bushness intertwining the concrete jungle, but not a place in which I'd like to live.<br /><br />If Sydney was a website, it would:<br />o charge excessive amounts for information that should be free<br />o be covered in ads about stuff that nobody wants<br />o load slowly despite its ease of navigation<br />o be frequented by n00bs and spammers.<br /><br />I was quite impressed with the Toronga Zoo, though. Much better than the Melbourne Zoo, which always bored me to tears.<br /><br />Two amusing things I caught on camera, though:<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v192/Jimage/uncanny/Be1337.jpg[/img]<br />This has to have been a customised numberplate. Way too convenient.<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v192/Jimage/uncanny/JamAU.jpg[/img]<br />This was crazy. In one quick motion, I knifed some apricot jam onto a slice of bread--lo and behold, there's Australia, including Tasmania, with an ironically supersized Bight.<br /><br />The entire trip was worthwhile, despite the overpriced and underclassy caravan park. Had some amusing times, but the next time I go on holiday it'll be somewhere a bit smaller with warmer weather. Port Macquarie is about the minimum distance I want to travel, but I'd prefer somewhere in Queensland. Hopefully I'll find myself a half decent laptop with which to continue my Keen modding and such while on the road, though.<br /><br />Ooh, I also bought a copy of Locomotion, which I shall start playing once my attention span for strategy/sim gaming returns. Would've got Myst IV as well, but it was sold out at the EB I went to. At least I can get that closer to home, though... for some reason the more local slaxx0rs don't stock many decent games.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />The development of the hardware, and the greater ability to express every idea that flies into a programmers head, mean that game creators have made the new games congested with every technique in their power. The basic games behind all this are so blurred that people cant catch up. We should go back to basics  like Pac-Man  and play in an easier, more relaxed way. -Toru Iwatani<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
