This is ALSO a forum where people usually don't make topics other than Commander Keen topics... Except for Levellass... she likes to make a lot about politics and religion.<br /><br />But even in the Miscellaneious section... Most of it is computer or technical information. Topics about moving from EZ-board, Having Adlib sound, the wombat topic. This whole community is geared more for \"tech talk\" than mindless gabbing about different carbonated beverages of choice. This, the PCKF, no matter how you look at it, is a dry forum. There isn't a lot of humor inter spliced in the posts and most are just... like I said, dry. This is not a bad thing... in fact I think it makes this one of the greatest forums out there.

So really the only thing that get us more into Keen is to play the existing ones or other fangames &amp; mods.<br /><br />I think other game forums are more active because active franchises are on the edge of tomorrow, you don't know what will be store in the next game. Keen is not like that. And it can be good, you can play the old Keen games, relive nostalgia, and you come to appreciate the games more, because that's all we have, of official stuff. You also keep track better of what is going on, so the fandom is closely stitched."

I can USE command lines just as easily as 3.1. It is just that I prefer simple icons and such to black and white. (Or \"Amber\" if you had one of them OOOOOOLD monitors. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]  good stuff!) I am one who simply processes pictures better than words. I have, and always HAVE had trouble forming correct sentences, (Also due to my accent and the way of speaking around here.) and spelling correctly. Screw trying to learn another language... I can't even master my OWN! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br /><br />But what I DO NOT get is how you could have a perfectly functional GUI and SCREW it up. Okay so I think 95-98 were the superior to 3.1 in every way. Except for instability but that was poor coding on Microsoft's part. But even windows 98 required what? EIGHT megs of memory?! Then microshaft comes out with XP and uh-oh. You suddenly need an 800 MHZ processor and 128 megabytes of memory... yet the GUI looks, more or less EXACTLY THE SAME!<br /><br />Now with VISTA... I hear you NEED to have a high end video card and a fast processor.<br /><br />IT IS A FRIGGIN GUI! What would you need a VIDEO CARD for? I want that for games if I want to PLAY games but I don't! That's why I bought their 360 machine. Oh it must be because I have SIX different instances of \"SVCHOST.exe\" and two different instances of \"Tablet.exe\" as well as two different \"Firefox.exe. and some things I never heard of but are probably viruses running.<br /><br />I want a simple, sprite stacking GUI that lets me execute executables and manage files with drag and drop. NOT have things I didn't tell it to run running. (Why don't they put start up processes in an easy to manage place like \"autoexec.bat\"?)<br /><br />Argh! Whatever that was my rant.. <br /><br />I feel like an old hag now... [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-oldy.gif[/img] -----------------------<br />The end of this post.

This is for Windows NT 3.1/3.5/3.51/4.0 and Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista (which are internally known as Windows NT 5.0, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.0).<br /><br />It's not necessary to learn this anyway.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to deal with MS-DOS 6.22, but I learned MS-DOS stuff first with Windows 95 DOS-mode part (the one outside of Windows, without win.com, etc.). And I love Linux. I also like Windows NT/2000/XP's command console, but I wish it had more builtin features.------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].
