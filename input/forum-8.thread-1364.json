Now instead of ~$214 a fortnight, I'ma be getting ~$404, effective about 13 days from now.<br /><br />Mum bought me a deep frier a few weeks ago (after months of cooking chips in a frying pan full of oil following the timely death of our previous deep frier), and then on the night of my party I discover my girlfriend had bought me one long before.
