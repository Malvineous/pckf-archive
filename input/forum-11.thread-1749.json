Micheal Ancel was a damn genius for creating half the ideas that went into this game.<br /><br />This is one of the few 3D games that I've beat start to finish over hundred times, and still is fun to beat.  I honestly have honed this game into a craft.  I really loved the first one, but I love this one even more (And that's saying something, becase i &lt;3 Rayman), and the third one was aiight, so was Arena, but the second.... Was as godly as CK, Biomenace, and Crystal Caves.<br /><br />Has anyone played it as much as I have/liked it as much as I?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."
