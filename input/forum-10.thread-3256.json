So many things seemed completely arbitrary, the plot jolted around alot, and some things bordered on gimmicky (which is the one main thing that deters me from many, many movies).<br /><br />As well, that certain feeling elicited by a good fantasy movie (unable to describe it, I can only hope others experience it also) only showed up for me a couple of times, and was quickly stamped out. LotR was laced with it from start to finish.<br /><br />Add to all this that the ending was underdeveloped. If I had lived 15-20 years in a land underpinned with pure magic and then suddenly reverted to my childhood, I'd be a very different kid than I had been prior to the adventure.<br /><br />Narnia is an awesome place, and I loved the way time was so intermingled, with seasons transitioning in the blink of an eye, but the movie failed to capture the full spirit of the place.

It can't be as good as LotR because it was written for kids.  <br /> AS for the Christian elements, they dont portray them nearly as strong as they do in the books, and you don't really see it in the movie unless you look for it.
