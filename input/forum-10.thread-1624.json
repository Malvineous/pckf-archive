So, I went to see it, hoping my initial assumption was wrong.<br /><br />It wasn't.<br /><br />I'm never trusting their opinion on <b>anything</b> ever again.<br /><br />I actually sat through the whole thing, and watched it go from bad to worse, and even as it exceeded my worst expectations, just out of some morbid curiosity to see how bad it could get.<br /><br />I'm once again notching up my skepticism about new movies.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />A concerned member of the Preservation of Endangered Spleens Society<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"

		"content": "I have long been skeptical of any production from Dreamworks' 3d teams... The quality of their work really can't compete with Pixar.  Robots, Shark Tale, and Madagascar have absolutely no redeeming value next to Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles.<br /><br />Pixar seems to have the same storytelling charm that Tom Hall does... able to appeal to the kid inside us without dumbing things down to a level that is cumbersome to digest.  Just as Tom Hall could take a one paragraph blurb about a child genius who explores new worlds and craft it into a fantastic adventure (or six), Pixar has a kind of storytelling magic that Dreamworks just can't hold a candle to.<br /><br />I didn't plan on seeing Ice Age 2, because I figured it'd be another \"hey this made money let's do more\" thing like Shrek 2 was, and this just solidifies my opinion.  I used to force myself to attend all Dreamworks' productions, in hopes that they \"got it right this time.\"  But after the one-two punch that was Robots and Madagascar, I don't know if they'll ever get my patronage back.  :-P[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"
