		"content": "Thank you to all the PCKFers here on the forum for many wonderful hours spent chatting.<br /><br />I might have said and done a lot of stupid things in the past, under either of my aliases, but I am grateful that you have been there for some good times, and been there for some bad ones.  But, there are two individuals whom I have come to thank.<br /><br />To eK, thanks for the moral support and advice I needed to start listening to stuff other than the mainstream - especially Bjrk, whose music, once I learned of it, became a light of beauty that broadened my love for music far more than I could imagine.<br /><br />To Commander Spleen, thanks for showing a good approach to life, you are wise for your age.  Your expertise will serve you well.<br /><br />There have been those whose good humour has been great, and others who can only improve (I will not mention names).<br /><br />Soon, I am going to turn eighteen years of age ('bout May 12), which means my childhood will soon be over.  I will move on to bigger and better things shortly, but I may pop in from time to time.  Even if it seems a bit far away, I will have a lot of commitments shortly.<br /><br />'Til next time, take care of yourselves, and each other, as Jerry Springer says.<i>Australia, n. A country lying in the South Sea, whose industrial and commercial development has been unspeakably retarded by an unfortunate dispute among geographers as to whether it is a continent or an island.</i><br />Thomas Nashe<br /> - The Devil's Dictionary<br /><br />[url=http://kevan.org/brain.cgi?Kangarus%20Gyrfalcon]Weird information on all sorts of weird and wonderful people![/url]"
