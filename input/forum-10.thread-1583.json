Anyone else got any story?<br /><br />The pilot, along with a few others, can be found here: http://www.surfthechannel.com/show/Sliders.html[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Just remember that this is the year of the elite devil.<br /><br />1337 + 666 = 2003[hr][/quote]<br /><br />\"God is love.\" 1 john 4:8<br />\"Love is not jealous.\" 1 corinthians 13:4<br />\"I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous god.\" exodus 20:5<br /><br />[img]http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3852/sheepsmall0sf.jpg[/img] <br />[url=http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/blacksheep/trailer/]trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/blacksheep/trailer/[/url]"

		"content": "Sliders was a great series at first, but after a few seasons the plot started to drag on to nowhere in particular. I never saw the first episode, and I heard it was rather excellent. I'll head right over and download it.<br /><br />Thinking back, Sliders stirs up some very strange memories.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> Bleh... or maybe I'll download it via BitTorrent. Not gonna watch it YouTube style."

		"content": "For me, sliders was pretty cool until, as Spleen said, it got out of its first season. It's just... a weird show. And it got VERY episodic and crappy. (Like Voyager.)<br /><br />Besides I didn't like the main character. He was a dork.-----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."
