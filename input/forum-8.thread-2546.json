		"content": "Garrrg!! Computers are crashing around me! My Athlon XP 3200+ CPU died the other day, then the next day I attempted to move a 1GHz into another case so I could work out why it kept restarting and the motherboard stopped working.<br /><br />I'm cruising eBay at the moment for something to replace the dead parts. So far the best CPU I've found for a decent price is a Sempron 2600+ at about $60.<br /><br />And just now at the Neighbourhood House, where I'm volunteering, a computer two metres to my left died due to a hard disk failure and we're having problems with the email server timing out.<br /><br />The same kind of thing happened 24 months ago when my PII 350 crashed (the onboard video chip collapsed) and I was forced to use a P75 as my primary computer for a while. Hopefully next year follows a similar pattern as 2004 when I was given a dual-500 and then sold a cheap 1GHz...<br /><br />For the time being, I'm setting up a 450 or something (since my brother and sister are now using the two aforementioned machines) and get back into some coding and such.<br /><br />If that crashes, I'm putting all my computers away until this bloody psychic electrocide ends, maybe get back into some art or something for a while.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />A concerned member of the Preservation of Endangered Spleens Society<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"

It was my n00b application of thermal paste causing the problem, along with some BIOS settings that did indeed need to be tweaked. It's also entirely possible the other mobo is still functional if I take the battery out and leave it for a while. Sometimes things really aren't as bad as they seem. Now I can code, mod, surf and play in peace.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I'm building up some cash to purchase a brand new 3500 machine. Should have it cranking sometime in January.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />A concerned member of the Preservation of Endangered Spleens Society<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
