Right now, I don't have anything to render it in (but you can assume I can get whatever program somewhere).  I need to render it in no less than 700 different perspectives.<br /><br />Furthermore, does anyone have a 3D animation of this sheep moving?  Specifically, I need to take several models representing this sheep moving (like lifting feet up, putting it back down, until it looks like the first model) and do the 700 renderings for each of the models, to get the sprite sheets I need lol.<br /><br />Thank you!  If anyone wants to know what this is for, feel free to pm me.<br /><br />Edit: If anyone has the same thing for different types of zombies, that'd be completely awesome.<br /><br />Edit: I just realized the above perfectly describes what I need."
