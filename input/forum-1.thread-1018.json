Instead of wasting time and space coming up with ideas that many people have had before (the Keen community has been around for a long time) why not try to learn how to mod and code?<br /><br />Remember that ideas aren't exclusive to you. I could sit here and roll off a list of ideas all day, but they're no use to anyone if I don't make them happen. People aren't going to put work into an idea just because you suggested it.<br /><br />If you don't know where to begin, we can walk you through the basics of all these things and help you to learn.

If you come in and post 30 all by yourself, people are going to be a little annoyed.  :-)<br /><br />Slow down and read what's already around, maybe download some programs from Spatang.com and try them for yourself.  You've mentioned before that you were too lazy to try out your Game Maker... why not put some time in and learn how to do it?  Show us all how YOU imagine the next Commander Keen game to be.<br /><br />In the past, some of the newer members were put on a post limit--where they could only make 8 posts per day, period.
