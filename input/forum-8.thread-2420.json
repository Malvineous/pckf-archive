[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br />In the cases that Jon does know what Garfield is thinking, I'm actually blaming Garfield's very own facial expressions.<br />Garfield's a cartoon of course, but even with real life animals sometimes you just know what they are thinking.<br />There's just the way a tail is wagged, or the way a glint in an eye appears, the way a head is held... more subtle stuff.<br />Of course you can't always be completely sure, but if it's your own pet, you'll definately get a feeling for eachother's emotions, if not thoughts.Retodon8<br />You live, you die, you are remembered, you are forgotten.
