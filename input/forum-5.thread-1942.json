In most cases, you make a copy of your Keen episode folder, copy the mod's files into that folder (overwriting what you need to) and then running the .BAT file included.<br /><br />Often times, Keen1 mods will have the full game packaged with the mod, since Keen1 is shareware.<br /><br />Let us know if you have trouble!  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>"
