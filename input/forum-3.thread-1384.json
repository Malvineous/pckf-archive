You can argue the clich that you have to make a level for your own and not for everyone else. But hey, if this is so than why would you bother to upload your level. Why would you call a project a competition? The answer is obvious; to show everyone what you made. Because you cant know who exactly notice your work you have to do it with the replies you receive. And thats where comes a not so obvious question in: why would you bother to upload anything if your work more or less gets ignored? <br />We got a level pack with 16 levels by 16 different people but the amount of people voting doesnt rise above ten and the people replies to the end result topic hardly half of that. How lame is that? What the competition worth this way? I know I tend to get quickly disappointed by people but this is yet another slap in the face. It confirms my opinion about the lacking attitude of most Keeners, something thats a danger for such a small community. <br />-----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Falling.gif[/img]"

Keen 2 just wouldn't be keen 2 without them, whereas keen 1 is still keen 1 without the ship parts.  All we need is a patch that changes the amount of tantalus rays needed to be shot (set it like 1 more than the amount of levels perhaps).<br /><br />Light switches and vorticon elders should be optional (I had a yorp message in my keen 1 level, even though there was no message for it)."
