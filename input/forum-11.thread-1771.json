Please give us more information about the game--which genre does it fall under, when was it released, what platform does it play on, etc?  <br /><br />Also, capitalization is your friend.  If you can take the time to capitalize properly in the signature you're stamping on every single post you make, you can take the time to learn to use your SHIFT key.  Thanks.  :-)"
