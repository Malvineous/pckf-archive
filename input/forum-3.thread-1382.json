That reduction algorithm rarely did a good job, and although allstories' picture uses the colours quite well certain elements (like the purple/red shirt) just remind me of that horrible 16-colour scanned image look [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />Of course from a purely technical point of view, the blending between the purple and the red (and the rest of the image) is superb!
