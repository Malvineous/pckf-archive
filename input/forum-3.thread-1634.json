Anyways, it's kinda cool picture; it has a head that has a helmet on, but the left side of the face and helmet is Mortimer and the right side is Keen. If I remember correct the paint style was rather dark and lines were fuzzy. It probably had space background, can't be sure.<br />If anyone knows where to find it, do link me up.[url=http://www.keengrid.net/]keengrid.net[/url]"
