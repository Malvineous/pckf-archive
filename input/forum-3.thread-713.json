I drew Mortimer from scratch without using any references or anything. There's no color limit, so it may not teach you a whole lot about working with color restrictions, but you still might learn a thing or two about how I pixel in Paint.<br /><br />[img]http://dylangallagher.googlepages.com/egathingwithbilly.gif[/img]<br />[url=http://gnosticus.spatang.com/billypixel.rar]Video #2[/url]<br />Second video. In this one I actually use the EGA palette. Sorry for the filesize and length, but Camtasia is being a big meanie.<br /><br />You're gonna need the [url=http://download.techsmith.com/tscc/tscc.exe]Techsmith Codec[/url] to watch these.
