		"content": "Well this years E3 has gone and past and so what are you looking forward to now?<br />For me:<br /><br />Kingdom Hearts 2: <br />The game looks stunning and it looks like it will improve heavily on the first game. <br /><br />Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess:<br />Another amazing game. The realistic Zelda game for gamecube that seems to take elements from Ocarina of time but with brand new elements like horseback battles and transforming into a wolf.<br /><br />Sonic Rush:<br />A sonic game for DS thats has 3d graphics in 2d styled gameplay. The camera in boss fights definatly reminds me of viewtiful joe's camera style. <br /><br />The end is near. An evil force returns. And only Commander Keen can stop him, but this time he must team up with a super sonic hedgehog and a two tailed fox.

(Duke Nukem doesn't really need the extra publicity.)<br /><br />If you followed 3dRealms/Apogee games around 1998/99, you might remember they were working on that game \"Prey\" that was basically cancelled. They've got some other company making that game, under their direction. That got a lot of positive reaction at e3 this year."
