Im currently working on the crane and its not looking too bad. <br /><br />Even if your not an artist, you should still give this a go, its fun, and really not as hard as it looks. I will try my best to do as many of these tiles/sprites as i possibly can, so i hope you will all join me. <br /><br />Also if possible, i'd like this to become a sticky. Alex.<br /><br />PS: Incase your wondering, #1 stands for the tile number currently being re-made, and (DL date) is the dead-line before the next tile/sprite is placed on the board."

		"content": "Ok sorry for not clarifying, basically, the tile you see has been already enlarged by 400% (4x), all you have to do it basically redraw it, re color it (what ever, just improve it). You are not allowed to anti-aliase the edges (blur), however, you are allowed to lower the aliase around the edge. You are only allowed to antialiase the inside of the tile.<br /><br />Its best not to change shape or size, however, if you do happen to make a dramatic change to shape or size, it shouldnt matter too much. Once we start working on floors, poles, walls etc, then size and shape will be somthing you will not want to mess around with (for connective reasons).<br /><br />Heres an example of my work so far...<br /><br /><br /><br />[img]http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/2294/sofar5cx.png[/img]<br /><br /><br />EDIT: To give people more time, ive decided to change 'fortnight' to '3 - 4 weeks' depending on how detailed the image is."

Your allowed to use as many colors as you like, and are allowed to change colors, however, i wouldnt suggest you change to a completely different color as things might not work out as well. So in other words, you can change color, just dont go overboard (dont change a blue tile into green or anything major like that).<br /><br />Basically, the only rules are, you must keep the ratio, and save as PNG (gif is also acceptable, as long as it dosn't lower the number of colors). The shape of the crane isnt a huge issue like i said before, but when we get into poles, pole holes, floors etc, then we will need to stick to a template, but dont worry too much about that just yet."

You see the images already posted, so here is a little explanation for them.<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/z-one/status0.png[/img]<br />I've created the colored form for the differently colored parts. Preferably all on a different layer.<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/z-one/status1.png[/img]<br />I've created another layer for the shading for that pivoting thingy, and I've used this same layer for all of these later.<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/z-one/status2.png[/img]<br />Here you can see that I've pixel shaded all of the different parts. Use different layers for every main color, but not their variations, they can share layers (like the different shades of blue). I separate even the same colors with layers, depending on whether I want to blend them later or not.<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/z-one/status3.png[/img]<br />This got a bit complicated, as I've started to blend the different colors together and added darker shades too. For blending I simply used the blur tool, but I've selected the layer that will be blurred (ctrl+click on the layer in photoshop), so it doesn't go out of it's borders. When I wasn't statisfied I added darker or lighter colors to places and blurred them too. It can help to change the size of the blur brush from time to time.<br /><br />This is where I am now, I hope this helps. Is there any specific area that needs more explaining?<br /><br />*edit* just a few typos[hr]<i>The human brain is not user-friendly...</i>"

But if everyone submits an improved version of a sprite -- and let's say 5000 sprites have been slogged through and improved -- doesn't that mean each sprite, or at least a lot of different sprites, will have different \"looks\" to them? \"So what,\" you may say. \"Variety doesn't mean a thing when you've got 5000 improved sprites.\" But I don't know, if I made a mod, I'd want to have all the sprites have the same \"style\", otherwise it might look silly.<br /><br />Anyway, my suggestion is, when a certain sprite is up for improvement, that there be a certain \"goal style\" that goes with it. (Of course, I don't know how one could imitate a certain \"style\", or what that \"style\" should be. It's just something I noticed though.)"
