		"content": "Something just occurred to me.<br /><br />Tom Hall can't get the rights to his creation (Commander Keen) because iD still think that they can squeeze some juice out of it.<br />They probably think this because Keen was so popular back in the day and has endured the test of time to still have some popularity today.<br /><br />So, maybe simply by keeping the popularity of Keen alive, we, the Keeners, are ruining Mr Hall's chances of ever getting the rights back! Perhaps only when iD think that Keen's popularity has run dry will they toss Keen aside for Tom Hall to reclaim, if indeed he is still alive by that stage.<br /><br />So I present you with this suggestion:<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mortlol.gif[/img]   JOIN ME AND MY TEAM OF ANTI-KEEN VIGILANTES AS WE SHUT DOWN NOT ONLY THE PCKF, BUT ALSO EVERY KEEN FAN SITE ON THE INTERNET. LIKEWISE WE WILL DO OUR DARNEDEST TO WIPE OUT EVERY FORM OF KEEN CULTURE SUCH AS FANART, KEEN GAME DOWNLOADS, AND BANDS WITH NAMES LIKE \"COMMANDER KEEN\". KEEN CANNOT BE REBORN UNTIL HE HAS BEEN SCRUBBED OUT ENTIRELY. IF YOU LOVE KEEN, YOU WILL WIPE HIM OUT. ALL OF HIM.<br /><br />AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS NOW; THE DECLINE OF THE PCKF IS DUE TO OUR EFFORTS, AS IS THE WANING POPULARITY OF KEEN ITSELF. IT WAS EVEN ONE OF OUR OWN AGENTS WHO WAS BEHIND THE CRAPPY GAMEBOY VERSION OF KEEN, INTENTIONALLY CRAPPY SO AS TO MAKE KEEN EVEN LESS POPULAR.<br /><br />JOIN US IN OUR QUEST AND SAVE COMMANDER KEEN!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So, pretty crazy idea huh? Crazy enough to work! Who's with me?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Guys?
