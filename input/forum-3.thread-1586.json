		"content": "You might or might not know about this little program called \"Open Canvas\". Open Canvas is a Japanese drawing program that allows up to 4 people to draw together on the same picture at the same time. So yesterday Me, Alex87, Commander Spleen, and Synduo (Synduex) got together and messed around. We really didn't do a collaboration picture, we all did our own seperate pictures.<br /><br />[img]http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/8918/keen1collab0wa.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/7219/keen2collab4lf.png[/img]<br /><br /><br />Open Canvas has a replay feature built into it. Just run it, open the files and it will replay the drawing from start to finish.<br />[url=http://galaxie.spatang.com/oC11b68.zip]You can get Open Canvas here:[/url]<br /><br />[url=http://galaxie.spatang.com/PCKFcollab1.zip]Here is the replay file for the first collab.[/url]<br /><br />[url=http://galaxie.spatang.com/PCKFcollab2.zip]Here is the replay file for the second collab. (much better quality)[/url]<br /><br />I wanted to do something where every Wednesday (or so) I would start an Open Canvas session and let people join. Unfortunately I am behind a router so  I cannot do this, as the program bounces back the internal IP address and not the real one. But if anyone wants to host a session and draw something up, just drop me a line.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Blegdandsmeegdbanner60copy.gif[/img][/url]"

You guys come up with some great stuff using that tool, though.<br /><br />Does anyone know of a good collab whiteboard utility? I'm dying to try some multiplayer Keen modding, but haven't been able to find a good program for it. The main thing it needs is copy/paste and a few basic drawing tools. The more complicated stuff we can copy into other utilities and paste back in when we're to pass on our work. Much more instantaneous and effective than saving the image to a PNG, uploading it and then passing on the URL.<br /><br />Seems most of the Keeners I've spoken to about it on MSN are eager to try it, and we've spoken alot about getting the Community Mod back in the works. When we work it out, I'll start a thread somewhere explaining how to go about joining/hosting a session.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
