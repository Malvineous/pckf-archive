I can get Keen to do it for a second if I jump in one direction, and then hold down the opposite arrow key and quickly press the pogo key - then Keen pogos backwards until I let go of the arrow key, or until he slows down and starts pogoing in the opposite direction (so in other words, it only lasts until he hits the ground again.)<br /><br />Were you able to do it for longer than this?"

Jump.<br />3. Hit quickly the right arrow in air.<br />4. Hit quickly the left arrow - and hold it as long as you want.<br />5. After hitting the left arrow in '4', hit pogo key (alt) (at the same time you need to hold the left).<br /><br />Just hold the direction key and pogo backwards as long as you want to.<br />Forks for both directions, on that change just change the 'left' of that example to 'right' and vice versa.<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"

In the beginning of pogo jump you often start to wrong direction but that lasts only for one frame or something; very small time.<br /><br />\"...neat trick, but does it help you?\"<br />Yeah, I feel cool!
