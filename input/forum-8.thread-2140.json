		"content": "Keen is a sidescrolling platform game.<br /><br />A platform game is a game where the player usually has to jump around from one platform to another. This genre includes a lot of games, both 2D (Super Mario World, Commander Keen) and 3D (Mario 64, Croc).<br /><br />A sidescroller is where everything is seen from a side perspective. It doesn't need to be COMPLETELY side view, I mean, Keen has a bimetric perspective and Duke Nukem MP is 3D from the side, but they both work the same: shown from a side perspective.____________<br />Don't think of me as an ordinary man.<br /><br />Even though I am an ordinary man.<br /><br />Ah, [url=http://DaVince.sitesled.com/]site.[/url]"

		"content": "Sidescrollers are games in which the screen scrolls in different directions (generally from left to right). This typically includes platformer games, but can also include shooting games, RPGs, fighting, and action games. Platformers are generally games that involve jumping to different platforms to get from one goal to another. They have in the past often been sidescrolling ganes, but can also be in 3D.<br /><br />So I guess it's up to you to decide how to categorize Keen, but ideally, it should fall under both.[center]<font color=\"MAROON\">TOUGH GUYS DON'T FOLLOW FADS</font>[/center]"
