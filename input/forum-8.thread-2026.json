Last fortnight that only brought my payment down to $300, so I still get a good deal out of it.<br /><br />That sort of income is comfortable to live on, but I have no intention of remaining on welfare for much longer.<br /><br />I also must agree with the comment made in the last thread you posted. It's not healthy to put that much emphasis on money alone. In my experience, keeping your mind on what you would do with the money, such as an improved standard of living, experiences you'd like to have, or things you'd like to own, will contribute greatly to you acquiring what's needed to achieve it, including money. Thinking about money and figures all the time just messes with your head.<br /><br />Good to hear things are working to your satisfaction though."
