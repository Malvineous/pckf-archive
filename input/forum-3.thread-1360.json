But I don't think it was the best choice of music for this. And the vorticola bottles everywhere were hilarious.<br /><br />Some timing issues could of made the battle scene a LOT better but it was still cool. That is an awesome find there.<br /><br />I am guessing that this was filmed in Austrailia? Due to the exotic birds and accents.<br /><br />Once again this is awesome!<br /><br />EDIT: And the 10 second trailer : [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCFB_JN9gQ0]www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCFB_JN9gQ0[/url]-----------------------<br />The end of this post.
