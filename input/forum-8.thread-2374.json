When light goes through a substance (IE: Glass) it slows down, which is what causes refraction.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />Incorrect, did you read my previous posts?<br /><br />In these materials light is interacting with electrons, that is it si being contantly abosrbed and emmitted. The laws of probbability say that if this occurs randomly at large scales [larger than two wavelengths of light] it will appear as if the light has passed through the substance in a straight line.<br /><br />You can think of it as a tennis ball being tossed from person to person in a room full of people, it moves at speed c when being chucked, but everytime someone catches it they hold it for a few seconds, making it seem as if it is moving slower.<br /><br />Another prediction of this is that every single shadow should have a small bright point in its middle. At the time this was considered ridiculous, and it took years for the point to be detected.<br /><br /><br />However, it is thus possible for something to move faster than lights apparent speed in a medium; this will cause a photic boom, simalar to a sonic boom; neutrino detectors made of swimmingpools of bleach solution rely on this mechanism to work.<br /><br />The speed of light is inviolate.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

But for the purposes of Science As We Know It, we need SOMETHING that we can all agree on - SOME absolute by which everything else can be measured, otherwise we're getting nowhere fast (at the speed of light, perhaps?). The fact that C was chosen to be our constant is pretty arbitrary, and of course there will always be scientists who find it better for their calculations to let C vary and choose a different quantity to be their constant, because it might be easier to use something else as a \"yardstick\", expecially in quantum physics scenarios... <br /><br /><br /><br />...probably...
