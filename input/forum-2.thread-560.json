		"content": "I started this small project in September 2006, and, although things progress really slow, I'm sure this will get somewhere in the future.<br /><br />This is a Allegro/C++ based game engine for Keen fangames. It should provide a good base for making fangames without programming knowledge, by being extensible and blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />Modders will have fun with this someday if they want more than 16 colors for their graphics, flexible AI systems, etc.<br /><br />I don't intend to repeat the same song again. Check the original announcement:<br /><br />[url=http://fortvortabella.commanderkeen.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=22]Teh Original Announcement[/url]<br /><br />This game engine is based on some ideas I've seen in action in some Keen fangames, particularly Real Keen Player 2/3 and The Mystery of Isis II.<br /><br />It's been a long time since Alpha 1. But, anyway, here it is Alpha 3. Started from scratch because I didn't understand my original code, there was too much crap mixed in it, my C++ programming skills have improved since then, and I'm using Isis II source code for progressing faster on this thing. It's not so abandoned after all, is it? [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]   <br /><br />This game engine will run on Windows and GNU/Linux (although it's currently being developed and tested only for the last one).<br /><br />Not much to say. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-pig.gif[/img]   <br /><br />edit: I originally intended this to be in Unofficial Keen games forum.------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].

I'd actually progress and write code IF someone told me what the code should do (i.e. a fangame project was relying on this engine).<br /><br />I was wondering how this specification would make for tilemaps:<br />[url=http://shadowm.rewound.net/src/meta/meta_tilemap_spec.txt]META engine Tilemap format specification version 0.1[/url]<br /><br />I'm not sure about the file sizes, but it shouldn't be a problem with Zlib compression algorithms, but I've been thinking about this for a long time, and today, I finally wrote it down completely.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this format is similar to TED5 tilemap format in some way, correct me if I'm wrong.------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].
