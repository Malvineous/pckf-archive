Sure, reclining seats is a novelty, but the screen was rather small and the snobbish looking old people sitting next to us were noisy and creepy. I think I'll just buy my own.<br /><br />Apparently Deja Vu is good. A friend was telling me about it today. I'll probably watch it during my travels in the next two weeks. I'm looking forward to Hannibal Rising, too.<br /><br />ROFL. I just had to rewrite this message because I thought I did something stupid--it disappeared into a blank Post page.
