Personally I think they look cuter that way.<br />[hr]I've always done the same. Probably because, IIRK, Spot is drawn that way in the Keen2 ending sequence. Even though I've since realised they don't appear that way in Keen1, I still normally draw/sculpt the tooth at the top, though sometimes just for the sake of doing something different I'll put it in the lower jaw.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />The development of the hardware, and the greater ability to express every idea that flies into a programmers head, mean that game creators have made the new games congested with every technique in their power. The basic games behind all this are so blurred that people cant catch up. We should go back to basics  like Pac-Man  and play in an easier, more relaxed way. -Toru Iwatani<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
