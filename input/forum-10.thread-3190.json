Also, even if I don't really care about actors, these movies have many good actors that fit in their role perfectly.

		"content": "Calling Pirates 3 \"an absolute disaster\" when you haven't seen the first two seems kind of silly.  Unlike movies that don't really need sequels (like Oceans 13, which I enjoyed, none-the-less), Pirates 3 was the conclusion of a story arc.  It's like reading Return of the King without having more than heard the name of Frodo before and thinking it's a disaster, as you have no idea of the aims and driving forces of the characters.--------------------<br />[url=http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/]Cerebral Cortex 314[/url] - For All of your Commander Keen Needs.<br />[url=http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/dave/joes.html]Eat at Joes[/url]"
