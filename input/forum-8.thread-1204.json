		"content": "Yes, its just a few hours to go before the end of 2005, and I thought I may as well get this topic started early, as there's not much chance you'll actually be able to do something worthy of an award before the year ends.<br /><br />The Mort awards are only awarded to those who wish to participate; if you are seriously offended [and don't want a nice little statuette on your cofee table] then state so in this topic and you will be dropped from nomination [This does not apply to Harvey Or Najawa, by popular request] Also, there will be no insults or flaming in this topic, this is a calm polite discussion, not a chance to hurl insults.<br /><br />Currently this is the nomination phase, nominate peole for existing categories, or nominate a new category. As I'm too lazy to browze all the topics, nominations will probbably be needed. Feel free also to vote, votes can be changed. Nominations close next week. Current categories are:<br /><br /><br /><b>1.) Community Dispirit:</b> The Keener who has acted the most Mortlike during the past year.<br /><br /><i>Nominiees:</i> Ek Djaser[1 vote] Harvey Levellord Lord of Globox[1 vote] Najawa[3 votes] Xtra<br /><br /><b>2.) Artwork:</b> The keener who has done either the best picture of Mort, the worst picture of Keen or a piece of artwork so devilish it deserves an award.<br /><br /><i>Nominiees:</i> Galaxieretter Bp[1vote][img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/pchic002.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br /><b>3.)Fanfiction:</b> The Keener who has shown Mort in the most positive light, or Keen in the most negitive light, or has just written an evil fanfic.<br /><br /><i>Nominiees:</i> Harvey[2 votes] Levellord[1 vote] Najawa[1 vote] Sarah[ 1 vote]<br /><br /><br /><b>4.) Modding:</b> The mod that made the most Keeners give up in sheer frustration, or whose graphics cused the most siezures, or generally pissed the hell outta you.<br /><br /><i>Nominiees:</i> KeenRush[1 vote] Najawa[1 vote] Xky[2 votes]<br /><br /><br /><b>5.) The Web:</b> The most Mortish website, or just a website that annoys or amuses you.<br /><br /><i>Nominees:</i> Bp[1 vote] CC314[1 vote] Najawa.com [2 votes] <br /><br /><br /><b>6.) That little something:</b> Just someone who you think deserves a Mort award for something they've done this year, whatever that may be.<br /><br /><i>Nominees:</i> Galxieretter <i><b>and</b></i> Levellord[3 votes] Najawa[2 votes] Br1ck [1 vote] Xtra[1 vote] Spleen[1 vote]<br /><br /><br /><br />Get voting!<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
