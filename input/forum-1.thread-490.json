It used to work.<br /><br />I kinda want this fixed.<br /><br />-- NAJAWA --<br /><br />BTW - Why od people keep complaining about Keen not working on XP; It works just fine on mine: I just don't get the music; I use VDM Sound for that (If I care). I do know that keen cannot run on a 64 bit OS under no circumstances. I hope Billy Gates fixes that one before Billy Blaze fixes him; for good [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mischief.gif[/img] ."

		"content": "Keen runs on WinXP because WinXP has a built-in DOS layer that emulates some - but not all - aspects of DOS. This is why you hear no sound in Keen and why TED refuses to work. 64-bit systems have a similar layer, but it emulates Win32 instead - there will never be support for DOS programs in any future version of Windows, whether it be 32- or 64-bit. (Use DOSBox instead.)[url=http://www.toxicsheep.com]www.toxicsheep.com[/url]<br />[img]http://www.toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobblersig.php[/img]"

I'm not sure why it happens, but from memory the error message was something about one of those creatures walking off the edge of the map.<br /><br />I've always seemed to avoid the bug if I jump around a bit at the start.  Not sure exactly, but if you put on jump cheat and jump up quite high and over that first creature that seems to stop it from happening, at least for me.  Also shooting it straight away sometimes helps."
