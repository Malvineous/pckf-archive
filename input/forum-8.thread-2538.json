The first words he said were 'Y'know, I'm a coal miner, chicks dig me.'<br /><br />Now our toilet doesn't work couse the peipes broken, and my gardern is in ruins!<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
