Since you got to do the game all over, for each level you enter, just type GOD and you'll waltz through all the levels without you having to go through all that time again. <br /><br />On the final level where the bottle is placed, don't allow yourself to be sucked into the exit door. Just keep the pogo stick on until you get the bottle and then turn off the pogo stick and exit.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
