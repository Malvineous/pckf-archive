I kinda feared that to be the case as I didn't see any indication of one while playing through the game.  Keen 2 is pathetically easy.  I remember getting stuck on one level because I didn't know the purpose of the lights.  Once you get that, the few challenging parts aren't that challenging.<br /><br />Xky, I dind't know what the lights were for when I played your keen2 mod, so I never turned them off.  I then found some message in the bottom of one of the keen 2 original levels that told me what the lights do."

It would be easy to allow 64 levels, and adding a 17th 'extra' level is a piece of cake, even without patching [it uses an unused little bit of code] Apparently Keen 2 being all mapped out 'n' such just did have the right 'feel' for a secret level. <br /><br />As for KeenDreams, I was walking on the map one day when I entered a piece of grass by Castle Tuberia. I emerged in a very small, point filled level that I have never been able to get to again.
