		"content": "Your site design isn't bad, but it shouldn't be made with tables (hiss).<br /><br />CSS is able to both style and position your page. For example, take [url=http://csszengarden.com]CSS Zen Garden[/url]. How is it that designers are able to tranform [url=http://www.csszengarden.com/zengarden-sample.html]this[/url] into [url=http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/177/177.css&page=0]this[/url] or [url=http://csszengarden.com/?cssfile=157/157.css]this[/url] without changing the HTML? The answer is CSS.<br /><br />The problem with CSS is that whilst it is incredibly useful for styling your page, positioning takes a little more getting used to. Here's an example of a basic HTML document, no styling:[pre] &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Test Page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;My Test Page!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this is about&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a page that has no styling or extra markup. It is simply here to demonstrate how to change the style of a page using only CSS. This is a page that has no styling or extra markup. It is simply here to demonstrate how to change the style of a page using only CSS. This is a... {etc}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;[/pre]<br />And this will give you something like [url=http://www.stephenarnott.plus.com/css_tutorial/test.htm]this[/url].<br /><br />Now for the CSS bit. This stylesheet will change the text so that it is red and the headers so that they are blue:[pre] h1, h2 {color: blue;}p {color: red;}[/pre]<br />This will give you something like [url=http://www.stephenarnott.plus.com/css_tutorial/test2.htm]this[/url].<br /><br />Now for something interesting. How about we make the h1 header hover in the top-right corner, no matter how far we scroll down the page? Well, all you need to do to the stylesheet is this:[pre] h1 {width: 100%; /* This bit is to make it be in the top-right corner */text-align: right;position: fixed; /* this is to make it float there */}h1, h2 {color: blue;}p {color: red;}[/pre]<br />And this will give you something like [url=http://www.stephenarnott.plus.com/css_tutorial/test3.htm]this[/url]. (Resize the browser window so it's very thin and short and it should work)<br /><br />More later.[url=http://www.toxicsheep.com]www.toxicsheep.com[/url]<br />[img]http://www.toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobblersig.php[/img]"

In my own system I let every database entry have their own unique id..

The function returns the results for PHP script to use, in case it fetches some data.<b>You hear in your mind: GAAARRRRRGG!</b>"

Yes, but I think you'll need to track down and use an appropriate graphics library. Java's built in graphics may not handle the task. It depends on whether you need to draw a few simple shapes or a lot of bitmaps. Tetris or space invaders would be possible, although not beautiful, but Commander Keen would need a bit of help.<br /><br />2. Yes, I suppose. Java offers fewer oppurtunities to fail spectacularly, but it's not exactly <i>easy</i> to write a game in any language. Java means a lot of typing though.<br /><br />3. Sun's java SDK includes a compiler, and the NetBeans IDE. That's a good place to start.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/YorpEye.png[/img]"
