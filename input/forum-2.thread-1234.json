		"content": "RocketJess, I'd like to ask you to help me with a Keen game im making. I've seen your artwork, and it's really good and just what I'm looking for to keep the game in the orginal keen feeling, you know, the semi-cartoon-like artwork and stuff.<br />I can draw all the in-game images (or rip them) - what I need is someone who can do original cutscene art - no coloring, no shading, just the outline of the people. I can do all the basic buildings and ships for the cutscenes, but not people and creatures. I MIGHT be able to do those, but they take long for me to do them in a good way, so I'd rather recruit an artist.<br /><br />If you're not up to this, that's totally fine, just let me know. If you'd like to do more artwork or in a different way or contribute in other ways, let me know too.<br /><br />Here's some of my game information if you're interested:<br />The total interface is like 99% complete, all I need is to make the levels and background artwork for them, and work out the story a tad. The harder parts coming up are basically making the Vortininja's, Voticon Elite's, and Mortimer fight Keen in a challenging way - and of course the cutscenes.<br />The game works basically like this - it's an adventure game, that doesnt have much of a platform element except in the enemy levels. You fly in your ship to planets and space stations, and when you go to a place there, you walk around like in Keen4-6. You can talk to people to get clues to you're ultimate goal: finding and eliminating Mortimer and his Universe Bomb. The game name as of right now is \"Commander Keen Galaxy,\" though i'd like to change it as soon as I think of a better name.<br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to ask.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mortlol.gif[/img]    [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-furious.gif[/img] The Universe is Toast..."
