That is to say, if someone uses a program to read the music data directly out of the ROM and encode it in MIDI format, that file is not allowed on the site.  Why?  I have no idea.  <br /><br />If I wanted a remix of game music, I'd find an mp3 formatted file from Overclocked.org or something.  If I'm snagging a MIDI, I'd like it to be as close to the original system's music as possible!"
