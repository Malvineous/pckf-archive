		"content": "Your monitor has problems with 720x400?  The Keen graphics mode is identical as far as a monitor is concerned to DOS text mode.  Do you have troubles with DOS text mode too?  Maybe it's your video card - you could download SciTech Display Doctor (a small part of which was once distributed as UniVBE), it used to add support for more graphics modes and generally made your video card more compatible with things.<br /><br />Back to the question though, I often use DOSBox/Linux because it's easier, but I also have a network bootserver set up so I can boot any PC to DOS and run games on it over the network (even if the PC itself doesn't have a hard drive, floppy or CD.)  It's great for getting \"skip PCs\" to do something useful (PCs you pull out of a skip.)"

When I was a child, I played Keen6 with sounds through the soundcard in MS-DOS (the Windows 95 version of DOS). I don't remember if I could hear music, but when I played Keen6 again two years ago, the background music was somewhat familiar to me. Maybe the sound card didn't play music properly. I like that sound card because it's the only one I have had with proper DOS drivers.<br /><br /><br />[hr]<br />\"<i>Eat your veggies!</i>\""
