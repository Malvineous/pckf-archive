Wheras 0-100 creates a small enough degree on a scale, and *this* is the important bit, on a scale that can be recreated in the lab.<br /><br />In the old days, we didn't have commercial thermometers, you want one, you made one yourself. Fahrenheit used the boiling point of water [180]  and the freezing point of a mixture of snow and sulfuric acid.[0]  [As cold as anyone could get in those days] The second reference point was, at best cumbersome and inefficient. Wheras water's melting and boiling points were much more constant, allowing one to easily create a standard thermometer, especially as you could mix various amounts of boling and cold water to calibrate.<br /><br />The Kelvin scale was created more for nitpicking than useability, spearheaded by the physicists who needed it for their gas laws, chemists and biologists still often use celcius, as they're familiar. This matters not as C and K are the same size, but people can identify especially with negative numbers [-20 is a BIG -ve number, must be real cold, wheras 200 is a big positive number, hot! 298K, WTF?]<br /><br />So in summary: F = old fashion Down south hick temperature, C = elegant metric [Not SI] temperature K = scientific, technical nitpick temperature.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
