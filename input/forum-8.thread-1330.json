		"content": "First of all, personally I hate words \"career plans\".. Since the high school is soon over for me, I should start thinking about the university (naturally there'd be other places too, but I don't want them). It's soon the time to make decisions that affect most probably the whole future.. And I have no idea what to do! I have too many interests, but not really skills for anything. Once I imagined about getting to the local university of technology to learn programming and that stuff. But well, not anymore since I don't like math and physics anymore at all, nor understand them anymore. (And I like only esoteric programming languages these days.)<br />My newest stupid idea is to go study art, but that would probably require some drawing skills, don't know..<br /><br />Anyways, you guys/gals probably know perfectly what you're going to do in the future?<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"

		"content": "I was always into computer programming so it was a no brainer for me to continue on to study IT.  There are a lot of different areas you can focus on though, you don't need to know maths and physics unless you're aiming for game programming or something like that.  In my degree there were only two subjects for maths (out of about 26 subjects all up) and none for physics, so don't let a dislike of one small area deter you!<br /><br />Mind you, maths at university is a lot different to maths at school.  At school you're taught complicated formulas to do boring things you'd never do in real life, at university you actually use the stuff to do real things, like (in the case of game programming) actually writing a game.  It makes the topics you're taught so much more interesting than they were at school.<br /><br />When looking at what to study after school, most people advise you to do what you enjoy, but personally I think you have a better chance of finding a job if instead you ask yourself what you're good at, what you'd be able to do right now and get paid for it, and go look at some jobs adverts in that area.  Then you can see from the ads whether you need a degree and if so what sort, and that will tell you what you should study.<br /><br />Anyway, enough of my rambling, but I hope you found some of this useful [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

I don't think drawing skills are requiered.\"<br />Yeah, I know it's different thing, but I don't know whether this place requires people to have own skills as well -- and besides, I'd like to learn to draw realistically.<br /><br />Personally, number #1 requirement for me is what I enjoy the most, not what is paid the most or anything like that. But the problem is I don't know what that'd be.<br /><br />Well, better to pretend that the day of decision will never come and I have no problem.
