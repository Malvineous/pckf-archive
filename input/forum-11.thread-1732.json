But surely somebody is in the know to convert the times of e.g. the UK to times of America, Australia, New Zealand and so on and can tell it here! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Please ask like this one to make a lot of people happy (I hope):<br /><br />Dear Mr. Miyamoto,<br />before longer time (in 1988 ) Nintendo produced a special version of the NES controller, the NES Hands Free, to make the NES playable for expample for seriously physical disabled people. I think the production of these was expensive at this time, because you used newer technologies like a touch pad for the chin, so there weren't many exemplars of this controller. But with your new technologies today, for example the Nintendo DS, it's surely much more cheaper to produce those hardware. It would be really great, if you can start a new project like the NES Hands Free - you would make happy a lot of people all over the world. :-) Thank you!<br /><br />It's important to advise Nintendo which great thing they did in the past and which they should make again!

It is playable without hands, you have to move your chin on a pad and can \"press\" the buttons with blowing etc. I read about that. And I wonder about Nintendo why they didn't make a project like this again although with their new technologies the production of a controller like this would be much cheaper than at the earlier time (in 1988 ) .<br /><br />So this is a good chance to advise Nintendo what great project they did in the past which they should do again! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />I posted my question to give the people a clue what they can write to help. Originally this controller was created for a boy with paraplegia (including the arms). It achieved a dream of him. So why shouldn't something like that happen again? It would make many people happy all over the world. <br /><br />Please help and send in a question like this (it isn't a live chat, you send your questions before) so that we can arrive it! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  <br />You have still some time, the chat starts today in less than 7 hours ( (at 8 pm in my country (Germany) ). Thank you!

As a company, Nintendo mostly just wants money, and they aren't going to do things just to make people happy. I mean, look at the decline of good games coming from Nintendo these days. They used to have at least 3 good mario games per system, but now, they have 1 mario game per system (64 and sunshine), and the rest are all cheap money-makers (power tennis, double dash, mario party).<br />Its sad, I know.-Genius314<br />[url=http://planetck.spatang.com]PlanetCK[/url]"
