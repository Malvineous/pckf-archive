The start screen of the game looks like this:<br />[img]http://real_hotdog.sitesled.com/Pictures/kdreams.gif[/img]<br />For first, I'm not sure wether it's a shareware or a registered version of the game. At first I thought it was registered, but now that I looked through it, everything in the game is the same as the shareware version is using, shareware ending text and shareware title screen. The only difference that I've noticed <b>in-game</b> is that the title screen says SoftDisk Publishing Presents instead of the normal Gamer's Edge Presents.<br /><br />Has anyone else discovered this version? I could put it up for download, but as I don't know if it's shareware or registered I probably have to make a patch for the registered version of Keen Dreams to change it into this one.<br /><br />I have also found version <b>1.3</b> (not 1.31) of Commander Keen 1 - Marooned on Mars. It can be downloaded from here: [url=http://real_hotdog.sitesled.com/Pictures/1keen13.zip]real_hotdog.sitesled.com/Pictures/1keen13.zip[/url]<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Okay, here's the link for the mysterious keen dreams version:<br />[url=http://real_hotdog.sitesled.com/Pictures/kdreams.zip]real_hotdog.sitesled.com/Pictures/kdreams.zip[/url]"

I'd say what happened was that a hastily fiddled one became the shareware, while one with a bit more effort became the 'full' version.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
