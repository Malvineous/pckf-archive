I built a P100 box for old DOS games and this problem appeared.  Any solutions?<br /><br />PPS: yay for the ezcode junk not working.  copy &amp; paste, then.  *sigh*<br /><br />Edit: Fixed your post. You need to have 'ezCodes' selected to get them work. --KR"

If the keyboard functions well, and it's not its fault somehow strangely, then no idea. Never had that happening.<b>You hear in your mind: GAAARRRRRGG!</b>"

Okay probably only me thinking that's funny.<br /><br />I'll do a proper scan (that was a quick job; needs more white background on the left there) and post it soon.  Front and back.<br /><br />I saw the thread at [url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumtheoriginalcommanderkeenga.showMessage?topicID=826.topic]p072.ezboard.com/fpublicc...=826.topic[/url] wanting the box scan claiming it's fairly rare; I had no idea.<br /><br />Love the whole series though =)  No good at it but it was certainly one of the best PC games of its day.<br /><br />And as far as the joystick thing goes, yeah, it's REALLY odd.  The joystick is definitely fine (works with other games), and it works with keen even, left/right just fine - get on the pogo stick though, and only left works.  I'd try changing the soundcard (and thus gameport) but that doesn't explain it working fine 99% of the time.  Too strange...<br /><br />And last, thanks for fixing the post KeenRush, the code didn't want to work."
