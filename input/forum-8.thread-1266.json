		"content": "This year, 2006, I resolve:<br /><br />1) To eat more responsibly, keeping conscious track of how many calories I'm eating per day, and to be aware of how active I am relative to that intake.  I don't like the way my tummy looks.<br /><br />2) To be more communicative of my own desires in my relationship.  I am not a doormat or whipped, but I do tend to dismiss my own opinions when decisions cause stress in the relationship.  Time to speak up.<br /><br />3) To rediscover what it is about Keen that kept him alive in my soul all these years, to rekindle the enthusiasm for modding I lost 6 months ago, and to conceptualize a Keen4 mod that makes people sit up and smile.<br /><br />4) To apply myself to my studies at college, with a definite purpose in mind.  Classes are not simply going through the motions; they are gateways of opportunity, and I would be a fool to trudge through with my head down.<br /><br />Good luck in 2006, everyone.  :-)[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"

Includes Keen modding/miscellany and game development but covers all manner of things.<br /><br />5) Improved decisiveness and proactivity.<br /><br />Hmm... I guess the general theme is stability and cohesiveness. I've lived for too long amongst disorder and unproductive chaos. It's time to change that and create an environment more conductive to my goals. From there all else shall follow.<br /><br />Happy New Day, Week, Month and Year.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Xky</b> 3) To rediscover what it is about Keen that kept him alive in my soul all these years<br />[hr]Amen to that.
