		"content": "The point of this topic is a bit strange. So I want to preface it with an explanation of why I even thought of it. I have been spending some time trying to think of a good title for my game project. Some of that time has been contemplating how the well known games are named, hoping to find some sort of clue as to what would make a good and catchy episode name that sticks in your mind.<br />One thing I've thought of is the fact that a lot of games are remembered by just one word, even if that is just one of a few in the actual title. That got me thinking, what about the Commander Keen games, how do you differentiate those episodes or sets? Each one is often called by one word from it's names.<br />Then I was thinking about those... Aliens, Galaxy, Dreams, and Vorticons. Then there's the odd and off the wall thing...<br />If you take the episodes in order of their release, without the \"rebel episode\", Dreams, what are they?<br />Vorticons, Galaxy and Aliens.<br />And the letters?<br /><b>VGA.</b><br />Wonder if this was intentional?<br /><br />Like I said, it's odd and off the wall. Just a thought for the day. Sorry for the weirdness. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-crazy.gif[/img]"

Wasn't looking for patterns in that sense, but happened to be thinking about the names and how they stick in my mind. Was wondering if two of the games had a similar name, perhaps it wouldn't be identfied that way. (I.e. say the Invasion of the Vorticons was named \"Invasion of the Aliens\" ... then maybe it would be called \"Invasion\" for short?) And so I was thinking about the names in order, when I realized the letter pattern.<br />Surely your right, it is just a coincidence."
