(Monkey Island theme.)<br /><br />Today I'm going to see if I can make it understand Star Goose. Then ZZT.<br /><br />After that I want to see if I can get it to play Commander Keen... Only problem is I don't know how to record it... ah well... one problem at a time I guess. Hee hee!<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img] -----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."

Yeah, better make it highly intelligent while you're at it. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />Heh, seems like something Billy would do. Interesting... How does it work, technically? Anyways, good luck trying to get it \"understand\" complex stuff like playing a platformer, not sure if that's possible.3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be.

I used my own... genetic data and, through electrolosis, made a fluid that interrupted the electrical flow of a series of flashing lights.<br /><br />I meant it was \"going to my alarm clock\" because when I woke up and looked out from under my covers the light was alternating flashing every second, on the buzzer.<br /><br />Unfortunately I was not able to do anything more with that... so I moved on and artificially inseminated a chicken egg with modified genetic data. Unfortunately I don't know what... to do with the egg now. I was going to eat it. (It is still raw on the inside.)<br /><br />And last night I did something that had to do with cold fusion... Unfortunately when I woke up I forgot it. (ARGH!) Sooo... I just dumped out all the stuff I have been working on. If I ever feel like continuing all I need is some of my blood, blood plasma, earwax, or other... bodily fluids.<br /><br />So yeah. I made an artificial intellegence and threw it away the next day. <br /><br />I'm still going to eat that chicken egg though.-----------------------<br />The end of this post.
