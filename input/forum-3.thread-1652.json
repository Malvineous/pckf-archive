They play in bars, so they're probably just yet another NZ guitars+drums+yell band.<br /><br />Well, I've since found more adverts of theirs around the place, and they spell their name \"Commander Keen\" now, and also demonstrated more of their copyright-infringing originality but representing themselves in the style of South Park characters. Hehe.<br /><br />I haven't bothered going to hear them though.----------<br />The Chasm of Strife (deceased): www.ThisStrife.com/Sluggy/chasm.htm"
