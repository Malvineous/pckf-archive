As it turned out, that was a *lot* Who knew? Here are the replies I have got from them, after emailing them the question; 'Can you please tell us here at the PCKF what the official name of the red guys found in the Pyramid of the Gnosticene Ancients are? Is it really 'Treasure Eaters' or will 'Smirky' suffice, or something else?'<br /><br />No reply:<br /><br />Tom Hall, ABC Action News; Tom Hall, BASF Corp; Tom Hall, Exxon Mobil Corp; Tom Hall, Goucher College; Tom Hall, HMT Inc; Tom Hall, Medford Water Commission; Tom Hall, Parts Un-Ltd; Tom Hall, Sunstone Circuits Inc; and Tom Hall, Yale University. Nevertheless, it's only been a week, so I'm hopeful of hearing back from them, or not.<br /><br />Tom Hall (tom@tomhall.com.au) writes 'I'm sorry you have the wrong guy, I do music and stuff, y'know? Sounds like you want some magazine dude, sorry.'<br /><br />Tom Hall (thall@isisph.com) write: 'I'd stick with Smirky, but I don't actually know what you're on about, our company doesn't have anything to do with your game, at least not what I've heard about it.'<br /><br />Tom Hall (tom@tomhalllaw.com) write: 'Your request has been rejected as spam; if this message was important please resend with the word \"CHECK\" in the subject line. If this problem recurs please email our system administrator at BPD@tomhalllaw.com'<br /><br />Tom Hall (HallTA@cardiff.ac.uk) writes: 'I'm sorry, you seem to have got the wrong email address, did you get this off a web search or google? If so you've probably picked up a random person with no links to what you want.'<br /><br />Tom Hall (tom.hall@sci.monash.edu.au) writes: 'Well this was random; still it beats most questions from first year students. I don't know the answer, but you bought s smirk to my day.'<br /><br />And Tom Hall (thall@squaretool.com) writes: \"What the hell are you on about?\"<br /><br /><br />So there you have it! Tom Hall prefers the name Smirky! (At least, one of him does.) I don't know how official this makes things, but it was fun doing!<br /><br />Szevvy Forever!<br />And Spleen never!<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

That's why I use \"generics\" in such ocassions. I just guess Tom Hall suffered the same problem. You know, it's not as easy as it seems to invent creative names for your characters, even in your native language. You can see that in the many Keen mods that exist.<br /><br />It seems that Tom isn't a person of the kind most Id Software staff people nowadays are. Those can't even be talked to via e-mail, which I wish, as I'd really like to solve this copyright thing by talking with the real person, the real copyright owner.
