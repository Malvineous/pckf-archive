Purnell who is obsessed by an evil spirit<br />Bonding him with all machinery whatsoever. However he has major anger <br />issues as in knocking down any person who destroys a computer.<br />And thus, he is a borg. And though he was attached to machinery, He <br />Can escape the rage in one way, a dangerous way that would be to reset <br />his immune system. Which thus would cause him to loose his max IQ along<br />with all public and personal thoughts.<br /><br />Signs of Brandons Virus are bleeding, sweating and <br />mood swings.<br /><br />CH.1<br />THE GREAT RACE<br />Bp!

Mortimer smacked Bp across the table.<br />Hes out cold said LL, who was still obsessed by her Fan Fic A Really Tough Day.. And hed make a nice meal<br />NOOOO said Mortimer who was still flickering. He is to be my right hand man And it may not look like it now but he will soon cross over<br />to the more profitable side of EVIL.I want him because his IQ is 313 and I cant let an offer like that slip through my hands, Now Mortimer was in a <br />rage and was prepared to kill all of them when suddenly.. SMASH- hasta la vista baby! said Harvey Harvey! I thought you were. well.kinda..dumb.<br />said Bp. Huh? said Harvey. noth Brandon faints while talking because Mortimer has destroyed Vorticon VI. Youve got to be kidding me, what have they done to you? Said Xtravase. Maybe Im kidding, maybe Im not but, in an infanant universe with no hope of survival what is \"Kidding\" but a metaphor used for no good reason... and bah said Mortimer I am of a different race, The BEST race that is really perfect and can never be flawed. I never care, we ROBOTS never care,"

PURNELL<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dedicated to PCKF with pride<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary,<br /><br />This all takes place in July on a PCKF event hosted by <br />The a mortal called Brandon M. Purnell who is obsessed by an evil spirit<br />Bonding him with all machinery whatsoever. However he has major anger <br />issues as in knocking down any person who destroys a computer.<br />And thus, he is a borg. And though he was attached to machinery, He <br />Can escape the rage in one way, a dangerous way that would be to reset <br />his immune system. Which thus would cause him to loose his max IQ along<br />with all public and personal thoughts.<br /><br />Signs of Brandons Virus are bleeding, sweating and <br />mood swings.<br /><br />CH.1<br />THE GREAT RACE<br />Bp! You know youre not old enough to drive yet! said Djaser, I know but who cares! said Bp. Ugg, I am taking the wheel! said Level Lord.<br />NO! said Xtravase, You almost hit my model of keen! What model? OH MY GOD ITS TELLA DUH HUN! said Bps mom. No! Thats my model<br />Of keen you idiot! said Xtravase. Ok sorry, I need to finish my cheese fondue anyway said Bps mom Cheese?! said Harvey, Ill be there!.<br />As Harvey said this he ran into the door. Oww, I have a cut. Faked Harvey. Oh, Lets get you some cheese fondue said Bps mom.<br />Yes! Harvey whispered to himself. As our little bunch of PCKF heroes ventured into Bps house, some one rang the door bell.<br />Ding-dong, Ill get it! Bp said, as Brandon opened the door he shrieked with excitement, Guys! You wont believe whos at the door!<br />Who? hesitated Keen Rush, Its Commander Keen! said Bp. Nuh uh!Said Xtravase, It IS Me. Said Commander Keen.<br />Oh my GOD said them all, And I have a mission for you. Said Keen. What is it? said Allstories, No time to talk now, Ill tell you in<br />the ship, said Keen. We get to ride in the legendary BWB?! said Mr12000, Legendary? Whatever, but yes. Ill start a warp.<br />As keen pressed some random buttons on his watch a blue stream from the floor to the ceiling came with a roar, a roar that would<br />Have made most mortals jump out of their seats and think a lion was in present in the room but most races would consider it a <br />Bloog, Bloogs are know for theyre roar and aggressive attitude and in the galaxy Big Baby are know as Blorks .<br />Wait! said Harvey, I wanna come two! as Harvey said this he tripped on the carpet which launched him into the portal just<br />in time.<br /><br />        * * *<br />Ok, now whats our mission? said Keen Rush, Keen stalked around for a while and then finally said,<br />I am sorry, but Im not keen said Mortimer Mc Mire- in a while a holographic shield flickered around Keen<br />and after the shield was gone Mortimer was grinning and in a bold snotty look. Mortimer smacked Bp across the table.<br />Hes out cold said LL, who was still obsessed by her Fan Fic A Really Tough Day.. And hed make a nice meal<br />NOOOO said Mortimer who was still flickering. He is to be my right hand man And it may not look like it now but he will soon cross over<br />to the more profitable side of EVIL.I want him because his IQ is 313 and I cant let an offer like that slip through my hands, Now Mortimer was in a <br />rage and was prepared to kill all of them when suddenly.. SMASH- hasta la vista baby! said Harvey Harvey! I thought you were. well.kinda..dumb.<br />said Bp. Huh? said Harvey. noth Brandon faints while talking because Mortimer has destroyed Vorticon VI. Youve got to be kidding me, what have they done to you? Said Xtravase. Maybe Im kidding, maybe Im not but, in an infanant universe with no hope of survival what is \"Kidding\" but a metaphor used for no good reason... and bah said Mortimer I am of a different race, The BEST race that is really perfect and can never be flawed. I never care, we ROBOTS never care,<br /><br />CH. 2<br />THE PERFECT / IMPERFECT ESCAPE<br />Run said Harvey I can lead you out the way a came in now when have saying this Mortimer had pressed a button that read borgs.<br />Too late said Mortimer Ive sent my borgs Youll regret that Mortimer said Bp, Follow me guys! as they ran through the corridor<br />a borg Shot. a faint Yelp Came from behind as all of our friends turned around and stared as they noticed Harvey laying on the ground<br />bleeding from a wound as Brandon said: Behind this panel! at this time Brandon explained to the crew how he was a borg and<br />he was possessed by a spirit known as X.A.N.A. I have a plan, since Im part borg I am most likely compatible with the<br />Mortimer borgs software. Which means I could communicate with them, I can use my camo to look like one of them but it would <br />dangerously deplete my system battery, but in return I could probably find the second escape and an infirmary to help Harveys  wound.<br />Ok lets do it said Keen Rush and LL who were at this moment more confused than Harvey who was out cold.<br /><br />                                                                                        ***<br />Cameo mode, access transfer, Borg said Bp 101010101010 1010101010101010? said Borg 1 101010101010!said Bp<br />Bp ran away in a borg fashion and met up with our heroes.   Ok, the infirmary is to the left up three corridors How did you do that? <br />Asked Mr12000, Practice, said Bp.<br /><br />                                                                                        ***<br />Ok, said LL I have got his wound fixed up, he should return normal aboutnow, Wow, said Harvey, What happened?<br />No time now, questions later. Said Keen Rush, Ok, the Pods are over here said Bp. As they all got into a pod through the window they saw Mortimer<br />running down the corridor saying things that would be censored in most chat rooms, Begin countdown! said Bp, 321start super boost!<br />They blasted of just in time because as the pod door closed Mortimer stopped for some reason instead of hitting the Stop Launch button,<br />Let them go! said Mortimer, I have many Plans in store for them!!<br /><br />In the edge of the galaxy<br /><br />Ok said Keen Rush, Is a big flaming asteroid good or bad? Uh, that would be BAD! said Xtravase,  At the rate were going we will impact the asteroid and<br /> go flying into the big yellow planet of Korath III,<br />We can stop there and get some supplies and then go on with this adventure said Bp We could also buy a real ship! said Harvey as he holded up a magazine page implanted between the seat,<br /><br />CH. 3<br />EAT FREE OF BLOTNOTS<br />Ok, now that were here on Korath what the heck do we do? said LL, Lets stop at that shop. Said Bp, Blot et food sounds good.<br /><br />                                                                                         ***<br />Uh, I want the Blot, I guess.
