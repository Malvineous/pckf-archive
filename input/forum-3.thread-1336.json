The excerpt they used in the QED was from \"Mars - The Bringer of War.\"<br /><br />For those of you who don't have access to a large classical music collection, here's a sample from the European Philharmonic Orchestra (cut to about one-minute long to keep things legal.)<br /><br />[url=http://www.shikadi.net/pckf/holst-mars.ogg]holst-mars.ogg[/url] (1MB)<br /><br />Interesting!<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"
