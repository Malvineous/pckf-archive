Don't read unless you've read the book!<br /><br />I got done with it this morning, I thought it wasn't as good as PoA or OotF, but it was still very good.<br /><br />On a note towards plot, it did much for the story.  However, I knew before I read it that Dumbledore was going to die.  I figured he would when Sirius died.  Harry is going to have to beat Voldemort on his own, without aid.<br /><br />The Horcruxes are an interesting part of the story, and they do shed some light on ideas in CoS, like Rowling said HBP would.<br /><br />I actually didn't think Snape was the HBP, or that he would be the one to kill Dumbledore (I figured Voldemort would get that task).  It was a real shocker when he proclaimed himself to be, but I knew, again, that Snape would turn evil at the end (there's never a Dark Arts teacher for more than a year, and losing him wouldn't of been a real loss)<br /><br />Which brings me to the final thing to comment on, and that is: R.A.B.<br /><br />In all my vast knowledge (Read all books 13 times each, cept for HBP, and no, I was not at the costume party... I'm not that much of nerd, well, I am, but not in that way...) of Harry Potter, I know of only ONE possible character who would have the initials \"R.A.B.\"  and I say possible because we never hear his middle name.<br /><br />Regulus \"A.\" Black<br /><br />I know, very unlikely, but sadly he does fit most of the characteristics, right age for note, possible right initials, he knew the Dark Lord, and he <i>is</i> dead.<br /><br />But I dunno, it's only a thought..~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."
