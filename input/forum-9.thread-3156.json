Aside from a handful of good shows you've got BS news, unreal reality shows, sappy sitcoms, and that whole TV sucks out your brain thing.<br /><br />The cathode ray tube in a tv tube does cause some radiation concerns right? Yet another reason to not watch TV. Or you could buy a 4000$ LED plasma whatever TV but who has that kindof cash?

		"content": "I didn't get this show to start, but I do really like it.<br /><br />The reason Aqua Teen Hunger Force is good is because of how random and stupid the characters and show are.<br /><br />It intentionally doesn't make much sense at times but it is funny and if you watched it more you would realize it is not catering to some demographic.<br /><br />If you looked at other good animation-type shows, you'll see that they are funnier because they're random.<br /><br />In the Simpsons, half of what Homer says is random, all of it is funny. Family Guy, most of the plots are based on totally random events. Futurama, well it's pretty random as well. These are all shows that lots of people worship. Or maybe you don't like them either.<br /><br />It's harder to draw a connection between those shows and ATHF, but it is there. Lousy animation - It's not horrible at all. It's not the best, but really, I don't understand why you care about what a show or movie looks like. Take the Day After Tommorow. I watched it, the characters sucked, the plot sucked, the special effects were amazing (It kills me every time when I hear someone saying they liked a movie because of the special effects). It doesn't matter how something looks really, as long is it is good.<br /><br />The humor in ATHF isn't really low-brow or crappy, it just seems that way. Give it another try, watch a couple more episodes. If you don't like it, that's your loss.[center][img]http://members.cox.net/aborlan/sig/sigpng.png[/img]<br />Crisp Grayscale Signature! 2152 bytes!<br />[/center]"
