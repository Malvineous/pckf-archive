And yes the sink level is incredibly out of proportion, but if the knifes were any bigger keen too would have to be bigger (and I like the way the huge faucet looks.)<br />thanks for the comments, new screens to come shortly."

I need help on things such as making the score system look like it does in keen 4-6, having variables such as ammo and the score carry over from one room to the next, and fixing some of the bugs that are still left.  I also need a beta tester.<br />You will both get your own spot in the opening credits ofcourse, so if you are interested be sure to reply!"
