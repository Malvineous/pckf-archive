This sort of streaming hardly protects your content from download.<br /><br />At least, that's how some .asx and .rm stream files appear to work.--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"

However, it's unlikely that even the best of your work will be stolen to make money - usually, some random person on the internet will steal it and claim it as their own, mainly to look cool.

So if you print out the sheet music and get a GP/lawyer/solicitor/etc. to date and sign it, then that's enough proof of the date you wrote the song, should anyone claim to have written it first.  Then any additions won't be so difficult as you can either claim you based them on the original song (which you can do since you own it) or you can just get the changes signed off as well if you're really paranoid."
