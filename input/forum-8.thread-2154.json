Blender is really hard to learn from and Wings has a better interface so you can get better accustomed to the whole modelling scene.<br /><br />Though it seems you're doing well already, from what you said.<br /><br />@Genius314<br />Yeah that's really the trick about modelling, once you learn how to model well, all you really need to know is interfaces and you can pretty much transfer your experience from program to program."
