I don't have Keen2 and 3 on this computer, so I can't use the Windows version. Whenever I run it normally, I can't get to the C:\\, and in Dosbox it doesn't stop loading, and iKeen being at the early state it's at crashes constantly.<br /><br />2. I can't run mods under Dosbox. Nothing happens when I try to run the .bat file. Yeah, I don't want to run keen at such a low resolution. I also want to use the anti-aliasing in the newest version.<br /><br />3. I can't register on the Keen: Modding forum because I used my email addresses trying to register a while back only to get an error, and now it says I can't register because someone is already using that email address. So it's more awkward to ask questions like these.<br /><br />4. I think I've asked some of these questions before. Garg.-----<br />Before you judge someone, walk a mile in their shoes. You'll be a mile away and have their shoes!"
