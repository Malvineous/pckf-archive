I am now... 1 more year mature!!!<br />(Which is strange, cause I feel just as older as I normaly do on a day-to-day basis, but what the heck! Right?)<br /><br />I got $65 and that is only my family party; no friends here... man, I really should invite my friends.<br /><br />I have a total of $110 now, and just need $15, and I can start modding again [If my data is recoverable]. Did you know, you can email money with paypal!!!<br /><br />*cough*hint*cough*<br /><br />My dad got me some AWESOME headphones... and my aunt got me a 64MB memory stick... or tickets to a Bucks game (Basketball). I just need to see if it is a name brand stick.<br /><br />Well... that's about all...<br /><br />Oh!!! I also got a tight ice-cream cake with a Star Wars Picture on it; I will upload pictures in the next few days.<br /><br />I had my dream pizza; Sausage, Pepparoni, Ham, Bacon, Canadian Bacon, Olives, and Pinapple!!! (We need an emotikeen for licking your lips, but this will have to do [think of a garg ready to eat a good Hero-burger {Medium Rare}]) [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img] <br /><br />Now that is it... wish me happy B-Day.<br /><br />The only thing which could have made the day any better is if Keen were there... so bring Keen into the Party!!!<br /><br />*cough*[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-birthday.gif[/img] *cough*<br /><br />-- NAJAWA --"
