The tools available for Tyrian modding are fairly limited at the moment, but I've got a few things in mind that may change that situation.<br /><br />There's also a nice compendium website, for more Tyrian news and info. If you've not heard of Tyrian, go there now and download Tyrian 2000, which has been Freeware for some time it seems.<br />[url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~vannevar/tyrian/]members.iinet.net.au/~vannevar/tyrian/[/url]"

		"content": "I found that a long time ago. Tyrian is an awesome awesome game and has a cult like following but... It just doesn't have nor ever had any community.<br /><br />If you look at the forum there are only a few new topics... the rest are years old. An unfortunate fate to a great game. (I thought that is what happened to the Commander Keen community for years.) I think that most of it is due to the fact that it only takes an afternoon to play thought the entire game AND that there were no sequels.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://img360.imageshack.us/img360/548/blegdandsmeegnewbanner2wf.png[/img][/url]"
