Now open your eyes really really wide, as wide as you can, and look at them--see how they look like the mesh DSL is working on?  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>  <br /><br />Similarly, as he models the arms, he'll probably model them outstretched to either side, as if Billy were preparing to hug a refridgerator-sized object... this is for the same reason.
