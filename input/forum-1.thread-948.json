In the Bloog Management District level in the place you get to with the rocket, you go down two shiny round ledges. You end up at an entrance where there is an entrance to a tower in the background art. You hop over the bugs and get onto the first gold pole, but the rest of it is really baffling. There's a lot of those lazer things shooting...Does anyone know what I'm talking about and can help?"

Now hop on the platforms and move left; rwo platforms will fall, but you can still stand on them. In hard they are not there and things get more complicated. Pogo up and left to enter the gap in the wall, careful a laser shoots left above. You should now be standing on a bridge.<br /><br />Pogo onto the platform at the bridge's end, shoot the bloogs and move up and left; then you can jump up and walk right; now you are near a switch, flick it up and move right to fall down, head right a bit more and you'll see that the bridge you crossed is gone. Hop down into its pit and flick the switch up. Now hop out and go left, all the way back to that switch you hit to get into the pit.<br /><br />Now another bridge has appeared! Go across it, then pogo across the two platforms you'll find, and flick the switch. Now go left all the way across the level to your freedom!<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/lind.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Pogo up and left to enter the gap in the wall, careful a laser shoots left above. You should now be standing on a bridge.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />This solution is too simple. You can also get few secrets in this level. One is hidden near the first three green ciliners. At the start of this level kill the Bloog and go left until the edge of the way and continue slowly going left until you fall. You won't die because there is a slightly visible wall above the green cilinders near a wall. Then go right and eat all hiiden items.<br /><br />Other secret is in the top of room with lasers. If you want to get it, go to up of the second gold pole. Then jump near the up laser, hold the key \"Down\" to avoid laser shot. Jump to the right short gold hole, then wait and after the laser shoot again jump to left hole and then to right up hole. And take all items which you want. It's very hard due to many lasers. Then go down, it's also not easy, but very interesting.<br /><br />Third secret is hidden in the down left room. Go to left with help of gik and turn on the switch. It will turn on a moving platform near the start. Also there are many items in the right wall of this room...<br /><br />Also the secret is hidden in the top right room just after the second green cilinders. Jump to this room, turn on moving platform, but don't use it instanly. Jump to the top right of the room instead and eat hidden items.<br /><br />But don't forget: all these secrets are hard to get, and use them only if you really good Keen player.[img]http://classicgaming.com/cc314/encyclopedia/images/enemyk4-wormouth.gif[/img]"
