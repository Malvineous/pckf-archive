Keen has to cross the Galaxy to fight the Shikadi, and this takes several hundred furious games of paddle war. (Which is basically pong.) Given the estimated average length of a pong game  is 2:15 (Oh so close to the magic number!) that leaves us with 100'000 light years in 4-30 hours.

In all seriousness he was a pain in the ass around here but killing himself? That's the thing with suicide. No one sees it coming until the person does it.<br /><br />We got rid of Harvy in an appropriate manner. Harvy was simply... kinda out of control really. I HIGHLY doubt he killed himself over the PCKF. If he DID he's an real hero.<br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-rolleyes.gif[/img] <br /><br />I kinda think Mega- *ahem*, correction, megakeen is just someone who is screwing around on the forums creating chaos and being a jackass. (And apparently so does Mr.Rush.) As evidence in [url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumother.showMessage?topicID=2531.topic]this thread.[/url]<br /><br />Somehow he goes from making incoherent posts to making a post that is spelled correctly and is actually understandable.
