It might not be a 'yes' though, it wouldn't be the first time a person or a company has been denied access to the rights for no particular reason.<br /><br />You'd stand a *much* better chance if you actually wrote the game, got it to a point where it was commercially viable, and then approached iD and offered them something like 20% of the sales in return for a license.  In that case they'd be much more likely to accept, given that the game is ready to go, they can play it, and also check that it's up to their quality standards.<br /><br />Of course you still run the risk that they turn around and say 'no'...but you could always write a detailed proposal at the beginning, with the complete story, sample level designs and concept artwork and if they like it, get them to agree to a license before you start.  Again, offering them something like 20% of the sales would be the safest in case the game was never completed, but iD might want you to put in say US$10,000 up front to show that you're serious."
