I would do that myself, but the sound doesn't work for Commander Keen, for some reason.[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Just remember that this is the year of the elite devil.<br /><br />1337 + 666 = 2003[hr][/quote]"

So if the files play at the wrong speed you can just rename them to get them to play at the correct tempo.<br /><br />Also, if you want to actually record the sound, DOSBox has a built in IMF-style OPL grabber (which creates .dro files, similar in function to .imf) as well as a .wav grabber, so if you run Keen through that you can capture the music to a .wav file."

After a while of searching for and listening to it, though, I wondered if my memory had gone insane - it was nothing <i>at all</i> like the tune I'd hummed.  Eventually, I managed to find some different versions of it of various quality, and found many of them vaguely resembled, never completely, what I remembered.  Some had the same tune but different tone, others the same tone but way different tune.<br /><br />I think Scizor's and Xky's are probably the closest to what I remember, though it's hard to be certain.  The exact tone of it (at least at the beginning) sounded closer to Sci's when played on my old computer, but Xky's is one of the few whose last third has the same [in his case, the whistling] tune I remember (I swear, that's where I went completely insane with most of the midis, because the third seriously resembled Nothing that I knew).<br /><br />I do really like the way Xky's sounds like one of those small pianos is playing chords to it, though [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] [quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Just remember that this is the year of the elite devil.<br /><br />1337 + 666 = 2003[hr][/quote]"
