		"content": "Java isn't necessarily a slow language in itself, it's just that it's almost always compiled into \"bytecode\" which is then run through an interpreter on the destination machine.  As these interpreters get better, the performance of Java will improve.  (And this is the same reason why DOS games run much slower in DOSBox - it's also an interpreter, just like most Java plugins in web browsers.)<br /><br />You can already get Java compilers which will compile Java programs into native code (in the same way as you might compile a C++ program) which although I've never tried it, apparently gives you a *huge* increase in speed (although of course you can then only run that fully compiled Java program on one platform, unlike the half-compiled bytecode.)"
