You'd be surprised how many musical noises you can get with just those two approaches. Varying the playback speed of a recorded tone can change its character a lot, as well as stretching.________________<br />[img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8498/missouriansf9.png[/img]"

Are they really *that* low quality?<br /><br />Since it's vaguely related I'll mention that I suspect one of the Epic Pinball songs seems like it was \"borrowed\" from a game called \"Pinball Fantasies\" (I think) - the Epic song uses exactly the same instruments, and even has the same title - only it looks like the Epic musician tried to erase the title, but only succeeded in writing a null character in the first letter, leaving the rest of the title the same as the Pinball Fantasies song...so they can't really complain if you borrow some of their instruments [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]"

		"content": "Not quite - saying a MOD file is like a MIDI with embedded instruments is just a simple way of explaining the major difference.  MOD files have tons of \"effects\" for enhancing the music whereas MIDI effects don't go much beyond pitchbends and reverb.<br /><br />On the other hand, MIDIs have unlimited \"polyphony\" (you can play pretty much an unlimited number of notes at the same time, although again you may not hear them all depending on the sound card/software you're using for playback.)  MOD files have a set number of channels (usually between four and 32) and you can only play one note at a time per channel.<br /><br />This can often mean converting a MIDI to a MOD may lose some notes, especially if it's a complex song.  But at least after the conversion it will sound the same everywhere [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />I suppose my point is that converting from one format to another will never be perfect, music will almost always sound the best when listened to in its original format, seeing as it will often have been composed specially to take advantage of that format's features."
