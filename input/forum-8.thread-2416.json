This newest video of his is pretty much the coolest thing I have ever seen. There's lots of violence, octopi, and zombie babies.

I mean... cool link, and that person obviously puts much time and effort into his creations, but... it's pixel art.<br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-yawn.gif[/img] <br />It's just not <i>THAT</i> interesting.
