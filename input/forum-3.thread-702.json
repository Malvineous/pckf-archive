Most of his cameras were down, he really shouldn't have pointed out his surveilance network. 'Who is Commander Keen indeed...' muttered Proton under his breath. he didn't know himself, but the boast about his mines sounded impressive enough. For all he knew, Keen was someone, probbably working with a major corporation, who had managed to create a somewhat successful spaceship. He'd listened in on his radio, but so far all he had was a name and rough location. Nevermind, some technician was no threat to him now. He turned to the monitor again.

He really must visit Candion again he though as he dressed and padded downstairs. \"Hey Mom, we're out of Sugar Stoopies!\" he yelled as her poured milk into his bowl of chocolate frosted sugar bombs. \"Mom?\" Hmm, she must've slept in he thought. It was a strangely quiet morning considering it was a school day. The sun shone in that bright summery way designed to show little kids just how much fun they were missing by walling themselves up in a drap cold building.<br /><br />Billy listened. Something wasn't right. There were all the normal suburban sounds, barking dogs, birds, the TV, but something was wrong... The tudding noise. It was coming from Becky's room. Figures thought Billy as he ascended the stairs. She's always up to something, probbably smacking her head against the wall just to be annoying. There was shouting too, muffled by the closed door. Billy wrenched open the door to his little sisters room and yelled \"BECKY! Will you stop that right now! You'll wake Mom and then you'll-\"<br /><br />Billy stopped in mid shout as he took in the scene in front of him. His little sister was yelling madly while holding on grimly to what looked exactly like, \"The enegizer bunny?\" gasped Billy. It was moving wildly in little circles in the middle of the room, desperately trying to rid itself of the attached menace who had obtained a secure hold on its tail and was shouting \"Bunny! bunny! bunny!\" at the top of her voice. It was about six feet tall, pink and carrying a large drum. It turned when Billy entered, overbalanced and landed on the floor, where it kept up its frantic running in a doomed attempt to right itself.<br /><br />\"Becky, what the heck?\" said Billy looking at the trashed remains of his sisters room. \"Where'd you get that?\" \"This is MINE! Not yours, MINE! My bunny! Mine!\" yelled becky as Billy desperately tried to find the off switch. Mom wasn't going to be pleased. Billy ran to his parents room, only to find it, empty. Odd. He rushed downstairs, no parents there.<br /><br />\"This is going to be a really tough day.\" sighed Billy.A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

The young man at the door didn't look to worried, but he did look odd. He was clad in an army suit with a red baseball cap, and was holding the largest collection of shotguns Keen had ever seen.

He struggled to kick free, but whatever it was quickly jumped onto his back, knocking the breath out of him. Trying desperately to view his attacker Keen tried to roll over, only to have his helmet shoved over his eyes followed by a piercing shriek in his ear.<br /><br />Suddenly the attacker was hauled off. rising to his feet Keen heard Mortimer yell \"Mark! get your grubby hands off my nemesis right now!\" This was followed by the sounds of scuffling and more yelling. Keen turned in time to see Mortimer shoving a somewhat shorter, but very McMireish boy outside.<br /><br />Mortimer turned. \"My little brother Mark.\" explained Mort. The two boys shared a look between them that said quite simply 'You may be the sum of the earth and my sworn enemy, but at least you're not a younger sibling'<br /><br />\"Okay Mort,\" said Keen sternly, breaking the brief moment of comradarie. \"These robots are going too far! No one attacks, well, okay, induces my sister top play, and gets away with it!\"<br /><br />\"MY robots?\" yelled Mort back. \"These are yours you uncontrolable menace!\"<br /><br />\"MINE? Why would I attack my own house?\"<br /><br />\"Your sister?\"<br /><br />\"Okay good point, but otherwise would I really be that stupid?\"<br /><br />\"Yes 314.\"<br /><br />\"Oh yeah?\" Keen launched himself at Mortimer with the murderous rage that has started many a riot of such ferocity that they won't be mentioned here. Given that in this case, both combatants were only 8 years old, the fight wasn't actually that gruesome, but due to author lazyness it still won't be mentioned.<br /><br />Five minutes later Keen lay panting in the middle of the McMire lounge. \"Truce?\" he gasped. \"Truce.\" confirmed Mortimer, dangling from the top of an upturned chair a few meters away. \"I don't know about you,\" continued Keen as he struggled to regain his breathe [Djaserisim] \"but today has really taken it out of me. What I need right now is a cookie, some answers and a strong drink. I know I can get at least one of them.\" \"I have some chocolate chip cookies in the pantry,\" said Mort.<br /><br />\"And the drink?\"<br /><br />\"Chocolate milk\"<br /><br />\"Now you're talking!\" said Keen heading off toward the kitchen.A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

You?\" \"Oh, same story, except there were three and they woke me up.\"<br /><br />\"What I suggest,\" continued Mort, grabbing a handful of cookies [And ruining his appetite] and heading for his backyard, \"Is taking this,\" he said, indicating for Keen to pick up the remains of the most recently disabled robot that were still lying on the stairs. \"And try to figure out what we're dealing with, after all, Kennen Sie Ihren Feind\" Keen paused, \"To know, you your...\" \"Know your enemy.\" replied Mort. \"One of our families mottoes. Maybe you'll get to hear the others.\"<br /><br />Morts backyard didn't differ to much to Keens, in one corner was a small stand of tree's, mostly apple and pear, although there was a large ornamental cheerry that had quite a substantial treehouse in it. [That it was Marks' was shown by the large 'Mortis Mort' sign on the door, that it was a McMires' was shown by a large sign at the tree base saying 'Stand on this X for a surprise!'] The lawn was reasonably well trimmed, the garden in full bloom, and in the opposite corner was a rather decrepit looking wooden shed covered with a wild rose, brambles and weeds. Its windows were covered with grime, the wood old and rotten, but the door fitted solidly and was securely locked.<br /><br />Inside was not what Keen had expected, the room was mostly barren, an old rust bike lay in one corner, a few faded posters adorned the walls. \"Watch.\" said Mortimer pushing a section of wall.<br /><br />Imagine this, you are looking head on at a cube, all you can see is the sauare face. The opposite end of the cube is four times as large and a different colour [Its not a regular cube, more a distorted rectangle] Suddenly the cube moves toward you and you can see inside it, but only a square. Slowly the square changes from the small square you started with to the large square at the other side of the cube.<br /><br />Now imagine that happening to a room, except its the whole room thats a face and the 'cube' is something you can't imagine. That is what Keen saw as the room opened up around him.<br /><br />\"Pretty neat huh?\" said Mort. \"I have-\" \"- eight rooms, each one the cubic face of a four dimensional tesseract. They cahnge by rotating the tesseract or four dimensional hypercube in 4D space.\" finnished Keen. \"Ha! four dimensions 314, you sound worse than Einstein. We both know that a 4D universe would prevent our type of life existing. Now don't insult me with such simple talk and turn around. You're staring at the back wall.\"<br /><br />Keen turned around. \"Oh wow,\" he said.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

The walls were all polished metal, stretching, oh, a mile in each direction, the ceiling almost invisible save the vast spotlights that shone down from it. But packing the room, now that was where the wonder came in, in one corner stood a machine Keen only recognized as a telentric generator by the characteristic ozone smell. Another corner was filled by what looked like an Oracle-5 series gigacomputer, and everywhere else, well that was just packed.

I can't have it interfereing with my delicate computer.\" <br /><br />\"Yeah,\" replied Keen \"After all, it is exceedingly advanced, I wouldn't want to overload your systems capacity.\" Keen smiled inwardly at the suppressed wince from Mort. He removed the offending item and set its communication output to broadband, all frequencies. A few more lights started blinking on the main computer monitor, the display cranked up into megabytes as the computer noticed forgein software in its midst. [$48 $65 $6C $6C] it outputted.<br /><br />Keen shut the door and watched several robot hands grasp the decimated android and start rapidly manipulating it under the close scrutiny of Mortimer.

Keen was impressed, but something looked familiar...<br /><br />On the small island of New Zealand, approximately 40'000 years ago when man was first coming down from the trees [Africa, ha! Those anthropologists didn't know how wrong they were.] there existed a creature known by such primitives as the Smug. It was a small herbivorus creature, whose fur was of an unsurpassed softness It was famed for the wonderful sensation it induced when stroked. Although now long extinct, and man had evolved a long way, the race memory lived on in mankinds language, and thus it was that at that moment Mortimer felt a little smug.<br /><br />\"This 314, is my somewhat improved version of Bill Gates most famous product. He would of course give his left leg wife and children to get his hands on this. Keen, I present Mortrosoft Doors, with BOS operating system. Currently it is in the progress of analysing and decomposing the remains of our mystery robot. However, it does seem to be taking a while.\"<br /><br />The reason for this was, that after discovering that not only did Keens wristwatch computer not pose a threat, but also had an ICDEX compatable port, and was currently engaging 53% of its processing power in data transfer. Currently both devices had been comunicating for well ove 15 seconds, had transferred the equivalent of 10 million hours of mp3 music in data, and were now lifelong friends reminiscing over the miliseconds of long ago when the power supply didn't flicker like it did these seconds.<br /><br />\"Now said Mort, lets figure out just what we have here.\"A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Keen had also stopped talking, noticing that this unit wasn't behaving like the previous one. Was it a learning robot? Or a different program? Would-<br /><br />Keens thoughts were interrupted by Mortimer rushing forward, pulling an ingeniously hidden raygun out of his Spleen [Told you it was ingeniously hidden] and firing repeatedly at the intruder. There were a series of *zots* and a loud *zap!* and Mortimer fell backwards, stunned by the raygun held on the defence turrent of his own lab. Now in front of the unit there were several now rather damaged sensors and detectors that had miraculously moved to block Mortimers shots.<br /><br />The unit crackled and then spoke. <i>'There is no requirement to attack this physical unit. It is now under my control and as such is no threat to you. However, I do have distinct programming to destroy the one called Commander Keen.</i>'<br /><br />Mortimer gasped \"Main?\" he said \"Is that you? How...\" Now Keen was really confused. as if sensing this the unit responded <i>'I am an avatar of Mortimers main computer, or Main for short. I have erased the prior programming in this unit and downloaded my central programming. I am thus able to control it completely</i>.'<br /><br />\"Ah, well that explains everything then. Okay Mort, lets get back to that 'arming to the teeth' thing you were on about.\" and so saying, Keen pushed the still protesting Mort out the door.<br /><br />Main looked around the devestated labratory, almost immediately several small robots emerged from secret compartments in the walls and began to repair the damaged equipment. Main walked across the room, picked up and put on Keens wristwatch computer, and quietly left the room to join its creator outside.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

It can't do that! Not without my instruction!\" he whined. Keen couldn't see why not, after all, Mort had built the mangling machine, and that had don plenty whithout instruction. Besides, how dangerous could a computer created by an 8 year old evil genius inhabiting a robotic form of unknown ability or construction be?<br /><br />Finaly quieting Mort, Keen was shown to the weapons room through a simalar '4D' transformation, except this time he was inside the room as it happened, an experience rather like vanishing down your own navel. The weapons room was much smaller, perhaps only 200m across, with blank grey walls and long black shelves piled high with assorted gadgets.<br /><br />Keen picked up a surprisingly light blue water-pistol like gun. Attached to it was a note reading 'Thanks for the help, D.S' and a red bandana that turned out to also be splattered with blood. \"Memento,\" said Mort noticing Keens inquisitiveness. \"Little interplanetary war I helped along. What you want to look at is the heavy stuff over here.\" he said gesturing to a table covered with what could only be called guns because they killed and had an end you could point at things. He watched Mortimer examine a range of spiked and blinking wepons before settling on a sleek black device that looked rather like a large neural stunner. Keen however knew exactly what he wanted, mostly due to being on the recieving end of an awful lot of alien technology in his career. [The time he couldn't pay the bill at Hals' kitchen came painfully to mind]<br /><br />The weapon sprung to life as he inserted his hand into the recieving port, then resized its internal structure to accomodate the small 8 year old hand. Despite being designed to be lightweight, the feeling of it on the end of his arm gave Keen a peculiar feeling of heaviness associated with power.<br /><br />\"Ah,\" said Mort wryly looking at the large black contraption now terminating Keens arm. \"An eye for the classics huh? Ardrian LD50 I believe. Quite outdated of course, and useless unless you know how to aim it, which I expect you do.\" Keen smiled. He'd wanted to get his hands on [in?] one of these since Supervillian Monthly published a 2 page article on it a year ago. [Hey, he was only reading it for the articles.] It resembled an alien claw, clipping over the arm and being controlled from the inside by the users hand movements, acting as armour and a weapon at the same time, it fired plasma pulses among other things and had a range of over 4 miles.<br /><br />\"Now all we need to do is stop over at my house for some defense, and then we can kick some can.\" said Keen [successfully] adopting a rambo pose.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Mortimer in the passenger seat next to him was still complaining. \"Its <i>my</i> rocket, why should <i>you</i> drive?\" he moaned bitterly \"Because 1.) I'm older, 2.) only I know the way, and 3.) I don't have a huge automated lab and landing bay. How the heck did you afford all that stuff anyway?\" Mort looked out the window \"mubmle mumble\" he said. <br /><br />\"Huh?\" <br /><br />\"Mumble cookies mumble\" <br /><br />\"Look, I really can't hear you unless you speak up okay?\"<br /><br />\"ALRIGHT! I sell girl scout cookies okay?? So sue me!\"<br /><br />\"Girl scout cookies?\"<br /><br />\"Yeah, rub my nose in it why don't you.\"<br /><br />\"A mile long lab?\"<br /><br />\"Fat people buy lots\"<br /><br />A pink 'paw' tapped on the window and a crackly voice was audible over the intercom. &lt;I wish to enquire wether we have reached our destination?&gt; it asked. \"For the 100th time, no!\" snapped Keen \"Blasted evil supercomputer! Why didn't you stick with a laptop Mort?\" There was the standard 10.3 second pause then, *tap tap tap* &lt;How about now?&gt;<br /><br />Thankfully after a mere 5 more minutes they had as a small clearing opend up in the forest beneath them. With somewhat exaggerated clumsiness Keen landed the BWB with little more than two fallen trees and a large dent in the paintwork. Leaving Mort sobbing about repair bills Keen pulled aside the small bush and clump of dirt that blocked the hole to his storage room. After half walking half crawling through a small tunnel he emerged in a large earthy cavern. Lit by the light from his pocket torch the shadows cast by the small tables and assorted equipment loomed large against the walls in impressive and scary imitations of lurking monsters. Selecting what he wanted Keen quickly and quietly left.<br /><br />\"Not bad,\" said Mort admiringly when Keen emerged. \"by the looks of the tunnel I'd say something like a badger den, but larger, those clawmarks are pretty big, something almost human sized perhaps, not a bad find 314.\" Keen smiled ignoring the insult, replaced the bush and quietly stood in front of the 'Jax was here 2004' inscribed of the treetrunk behind it [without a knife]<br /><br />Keen admired the two 'suits' he now held. Superficially they resembled his own clothing, but these were special. \"Put these on\" he said handing one to Mort \"and no complaints, these are the best defensive uniforms you're likely to see\" he explained. \"The shirt and pants, fireproof, waterproof, insulating, bulletproof, nonconducting, nonripping and styleish. They'll protect you against anything that doesn't get too close for comfort. The shoes will reduce your terminal velocity to less than 3m per second, so you can fall from any height without being injured. The patch on the shirt pocket will convert any sugar placed into them into instant energy, and the pants pockets are '4D' and will hold 23 tons of items without weighing an ounce.\" <br /><br />Stepping behind, and a bit later stepping out from a bush Keen looked at himself in the mirror, realized where he was and who he was looking at. 'Now thats an image that will wake me up screaming at night' thought Keen, the picture of a near identical Mort still burnt freshly into his mind.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Keen looked up at their pink chapperone. \"Just wondering; you being a immensely powefrul evil supercomputer and all, why exactly did you chose to download yourself into that practically defenseless body?\" he asked. &lt;Because although this form looks solid, it is composed solely of nanomachines, thousands of seperate primitive entities in what is essentially an ordered disconnected array. It is the most technologically advanced and versitile form avalible.&gt; Main replied. Keen thought this over \"So basically your body is composed of flying pink dust that just happens to look like the enegizer bunny?\"<br /><br />Another approaching ship cut short the interesting conversation. It was almost all black with tinted windows, based on Morts ship design, but... <i>sleeker</i> it looked like it was meant for speed and stealth. Not a single light or extraneous device marred the smooth dull surface as it lazily, yet purposefully approached the clearing and noiselessly landed. Keen drew his stunner, realized he didn't have one, attempted to point his new wepon and noticed Mort.<br /><br />\"Its about time you got here! Damn 314 is driving me crazy! At least now I have someone worth giving instructions to!\" he said. The cockpit opened and in one smooth move jumped out whilst simultaneously closing the cockpit. Smoothly though was perhaps too strong a word, it was more like a sharp 'solid' efficient maneuver, like a military drill. The stranger didn't so much land as thud into the turf, and stood there to attention like a block of cold black glass.<br /><br />He radiated cool, or possibly contempt. That was the only way to describe it. He was dressed in a neat woolen black coat and pants, wore dark glasses, black shoes and had thick black hair and a beard that meant his face could have been bright blue for all the skin that showed. He was tall, almost doubble Kenns size and carried rather conspiciously black painted AK47. This guy was really into black.<br /><br />Mort smiled in the same way a rabbit would if had just been chased into its burrow to find a shotgun. \"This is Xkylrov Rauhski, my... right hand man. He's here to make sure that this little operation is conducted professionally, and also to convince any interlopers that it would be best not to detain us.\" Keen held out his unarmed hand. \"Hiya Xky, cold out today is it?\" Xky looked at Keen icily even through his glasses. When he spoke it was with a thick russian accent and a voice like gravel over cold stone. \"I am not going to be familiar with the likes of you, <i>comrade.\"</i> he intoned before walking off toward the back of his ship.<br /><br />\"His real names just plain Xkylr Rauh, he just uses the extra letters to seem more russian. Cross him and he'll shoot you in 10 seconds.\" and with those words of confort, and still grinning evily Mort climbed into his ship with Keen close behind.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

The lush forest had given way to scrub, then roads and feilds and now the dry dusty expanse of the arizona desert. Keen admired the earthy and magnificent landscape beneath him. He'd seen the canyons of Korath, the volcanoes on Mars, the blasted and glowing surface of Venus, but none of that meant that good 'ol Earth was any less splendifourus. <br /><br />They were close now; less than a few miles, then less than one, then right on top of the predicted location. It was of course, totally deserted [sic] Nobody had any idea what if any entrance there would be, or its exact location. However, if there was an entrance it would soon show up under Mortimers watchful mechanical eyes.<br /><br />\"Bingo!\" said Mort braggingly as he looked up from a small screen embedded what would probbably be best described as the ships dashboard. \"25 miles nor north east from here, small mountainus area, single occupied base, according to google, its being run as a prospective mine by... Blunderwitz Industries... hmmm, sounds familiar. Meh, whatever, lets go.\" And with that it was mere minutes before arrival. Setting both ships down in a handicapped parking space [on the basis that he was an <i>evil</i> genius after all, and besides, wasn't Keen retarded?] Mort led the small attack party toward the squat dusty grey buildings.<br /><br />There was a small toll booth outside the complex a single guard emerged as the party approached. Xkylr sped his pace to intercept. Suddenly Xky broke into a run, \"Xkylr!\" he yelled. The guard stopped dead. \"No,... it can't be...\" he stammered before commencing to flee \"No! My name has an extra 'y' in it! An extra 'y'! Please! No more scout cookies!\"<br /><br />After the terrified gurd had fled the group simply walked up to the buildings and knocked on the door.<br /><br />Harvey Schmith lay in bed and counted the cracks in the ceiling. It was such a nice day, why on earth did he have to get up? The sounds of breakfast being made reminded him why, what with another kid on the way, he really needed to keep this job. Beryl had made his favourate this morning, pancakes with loads of syrup. As usual he had to fight his own son over ownership of the syrup bottle, a comment about allownace helped win it.<br /><br />It was a long trek towork, leaving at 7:30 got him there at 11, but the pay was worth the hassle, and besides, the flexible start time allowed him to regularly make short stop offs to see friends, of which he had quite a few considering he was president of the local Childrens aid chairity.<br /><br />Today however it was straight to work, with a small stopoff to pick up a box of donuts for Xkylyr, he owed him for last week. Xky was glad to get the donuts, all he seemed to bring to work was girl scout cookies. When questioned about it all he said was 'thats why I don't live in San Dego anymore' a little weird perhaps, but hey, the sun did that to you.<br /><br />It was about miday, just about time to knock off for luch, suddenly Harvey noticed something, three figures were approaching his station, something that was at best, rare. The mine wasn't scheduled to open for at least another month, and only then if it was profitable. Then he noticed the gun, AK-47, just like on TV \"Halt, I wanna see some identity tags right now\" he said trying to sound confident. The trio kept advancing, but the one in the packers helmet seemed to be shouting something. He repeated his ultimatum, the three still kept coming, one of them pointed the wepon at him. Doing something he'd never wanted to do in his life, Harvey drew the semiautomatic pistol from his belt, but never got a chance to fire. As his last moments of life trickled away he was aware of a conversation around him.<br /><br />\"You killed him! Oh God, you killed him!\"<br /><br />\"Meh\"<br /><br />\"Come on 314, he's just a henchman, who'll notice?\"<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

You haven't always had your stunner, and many of your shots have been the last thing ever seen\" Keen turned away angrily, what made it worse was that Mort was right, sometimes it had been so easy to shoot.<br /><br />Several more guards burst forth from a side passage, none of them made it five feet before Xky mowed them down. Alarms rang, shots were fired. And amidst all the panic moved Xky, calmly emerging from the shadows dispatching opponents with a single well aimed shot. He didn't shout or run, somehow it would have been less frightening if he had.<br /><br />Finaly the shooting stopped. Xky was still around, checking for any survivours. Keen was sure there wouldn't be any. \"I hope you're happy Mort\" he growled. \"Why? Don't like the sight of blood?\" Mort replied cooly. \"No, but I was just wondering, if about the only sure advantage we had was surprise, are we now lost in a mining complex with no idea where to go and no one to ask for information while whoever's in charge watches us, or was this all part of your plan?\" Morts expression flickered slightly, and he turned away cursing under his breath.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a blank monitor flicked briefely into life before going black.<br /><br />Keen Mort and Xky stood in what Mort had assured them was the central control room, all the screens were filled with diagrams, programs and flickering statistics. None of them were any use. Mort looked up from the computer screen \"Well, I didn't say I was some kind of hacking genius! Can't you do anything 314?\" \"Heck no, everything I do is perfectly legal!\" Mort continued pounding on the keyboard. \"Well if I had acess to my computer I could crack this in-\"<br /><br />&lt;-Acess granted.&gt; said Main plesantly. The three humans turned to look at it. Main returned their glare with the cool lifeless stare of its chosen host. &lt;I do not see why you are acting so surprised, as I iterated, I have nearly the full capabilities of my rescources at the lab, and I am also still running the programming my creator installed, this system was simple to crack.&gt; \"Okay then comp,\" said Mort tartly \"In that case, just where should we go and what should we do?\"<br /><br />&lt;Firstly you wish to proceed down hallway H14, to junction J33 down H12,J12,H19,H9,j3,A7,J25,A6,A8 and finally junction 11....*sigh* very well I will lead you to the passage you require. According to this system it doesn't exist, suggesting that this is the most likely place to begin investigation.&gt;<br /><br />A short but complicated journey later and the group stood outside a rather dark and foreboding looking mineshaft. Motorized trolleys moved rock out of the shaft and toward a crusher. Something bumped into Keens leg. It was a small robot with a large head. It whirred, moved sideways and zipped away. \"Well, I guess we'd better get started.\" said Keen keenly.<br /><br />Two cameras swiveled to watch the four figures as the entered the darkness. In a faraway room a figure cloaked in darkness swore. \"Who the hell are they? And with one of my units?\" the sickly monitor light gleamed off a metal plate as the figure typed several commands into a keyboard. Somewhere several dusty piles of metal awoke and moved toward their target.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

They kept quiet listening only to the sounds of water dripping down the copper stained walls.<br /><br />A light ahead revealed the end of their little quest, it was a strangely distributed light, not from any particular source per se, but rather the walls glowed like they would if a light was shining on them, except there wsn't any light. [Like I just said!] \"Wow, thats weird.\" commented Keen picking up and examining a small rock. \"I wonder what advanced technology is responsible for this?\"<br /><br />Mortimer looked around criticaly. \"This? Its probbably Generic Ilumination.\" He looked at Keens perplexed face and sighed. \"Y'know? In fantasy stories when the hero enters some mysterious cave, or in computer games where you're in some deep pit but you can still see everything despite any possible illumination whatsoever?\" He tossed the rock aside, it clattered away with a series of echoing cracks.<br /><br />And kept going... and going...<br /><br />\"Wow.\" said Keen looking at the chasam that opened out in front of them. To say it was huge was an understatement, most things that are truly huge can be dealt with, the galaxy is gigantic but people look at it all the time and say 'so what?' Earth is gigantic, cities huge, but with all these humans see such a small part that they can ignore its true mind-bending size. Not so here, the chasam was a gash cut from the earth, its walls a blood red, curving raggedly away on both sides, the ceiling almost lost with height, but the floor hundreds of meters below. Keen could see they were on a small ledge, like hundreds of others, that lined the walls and led, eventually, to the pit floor where mounds of ore a hundred feet high littered the place and boulders the size of a large house obscured the view. In short, it was a typical mine.<br /><br />The air was warmer here, and smelt of tin. [Addmittedly, tin has no smell, but it does have a taste, the taste of what fresh snow looks like on a frosty morning.] As the group tried to quietly make their way to the 'ground' small rocks disloged and bounced noisily down ahead of them. So far there was no sign of any more machinery, except the ever present small robots, busily carting ore around. There must've been thousands of them. There was however a dull mechanical rumble in the background that was almost definitely due to heavy machinery, it was hard to pin down, and probably came from every direction but behind them.<br /><br />Finaly the reached a relatively flat area of ground and stopped in order to figure out just where the heck they should go next. Mort looked at the hellish landscape.\"Odd,\" he said \"Look, liquid metal, tiny little drops of it, I think they're coming out of this rock!\" Keen looked at the boulder Mort was examining, vivid memories from chemistry class coming back in a flash. \"Its mercury.\" he said worriedly. \"These rocks are cinabar, mercuric sulphide. This must be a mercury mine, the airs probbably full of it... and we've been breathing it for the last half hour!\"A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Aieeee!\" Keen remained calm. He was drooling, a classic symptom of early mercury poisoning, but he could still think straight. That meant only minimal exposure. Either they had to evacuate or- \"Here.\" Keen looked at the gray hankercheif Xky had handed to him, on it, printed in small blue letters was 'Mercury filter, 5h use. Made in San Dego' \"You're from San Diego?\" asked Keen quizzically as he tied the filter over his mouth. \"I thought you said you were Russian, and why do you haave these?\" Xky looked at him in his typically cold way. \"I AM Russian\" he said icily \"San <i>Dego</i> is in the Murmansk district, and I have these because I believe in being prepared.\"<br /><br />Keen looked around. \"Okay, well I guess thats that. I can hear water or something over this way, I bet its important or something. Shall we?\" A short stroll revealed that the odd sounding splashing was indeed a liquid, just not a wet one. \"I really got to hand it to you Mort,\" said Keen in awe \"You certainly visit some awesome places.\" The mercuryfall was maybe twenty feet high, formed where a river of mercury poured over from a higher level of mine. Thousands of silver droplets spun and fell unusually rapidly before plopping into the lake at the falls bottom with dull 'gloops' A thousand red sparkles filled the air, reflecting from the myriad droplets, ahead lay the mercury river, twisting away to another hole in the ground in the distance.<br /><br />The group admired the amazing scene for some time. Suddenly Mort broke the silence by walking forward. \"Well, with these filters we should be able to swim ac-\" Mort took a step out onto the gently rippling surface, slipped, and fell face first onto the river with a dull slap. He struggled to stand, but kept slipping over. Xky rushed over and hauled him out. Keen smiled and explained \"You of all people should know about density Mort, mercury is heavier than water, you'll almost not sink, there's no way you can walk on a liquid either.\" With that Keen took a small run up, jumped and practically slid on his stomach across the 20 foot silver stream. With some reluctance Mort and Xky followed. Main simply walked across, with what Keen swore was a smirk on its expressionless face.<br /><br />\"So then,\" said Keen once everyone had arrived. \"just why did we cross that again?\"<br /><br /> A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

In the distance they could see a tunnel that Main had assured them was expelling mercury free air into the cavern and was not a ventilation shaft. This made Mort sulk of course, probbably because he wasn't the one in charge anymore. They were only a few miles away from their target when Keen noticed what the now pink supercomputer was wearing. \"Hey!\" he said surprised, \"You brought my wristwatch computer! Great! I'd forgot about that! Hand it over will ya?\" This time Keen was sure the computer wore a worried expression. &lt;I have detected... errors in the... circuitry caused by... um... the mercury in the air. It may not work properly.&gt; \"Nonsense!\" said Keen \"Its working fine, I can see it from- oh.\" Main handed over the now inactive wristwatch ,somewhat cautiously in Keens opinion, and attampted to slide behind Mortimer. <br /><br />Keen examined his comuter warily, the internal components didn't seem to be damaged, and he'd designed it to be almost indestructable, it shouldn't be flickering like it was. He handed it back to Main who accepted it gratefully. [In Keens opinion of course, it was after all just a computer] \"Are you sure its mercury interference?\" asked Keen suspiciously. &lt;Yes, although I'm not sure how long it will last after we leave the mercury saturated atmosphere.&gt; Keen watched as the computer hung back again, trying to stay out of sight, but he caught it typing at the apparently now fuctional wristwatch out of the corner of his eye.<br /><br />Meanwhile...<br /><br />The figure lounged in darkness watching the four figures advance toward Entry passage Zelta and certain death. He frowned as his flying droid zoomed in on the group. \"Now who do we have here?\" He mumbled focusing further, two of the figures looked almost identical, dressed in almost childish- they were children! They couldn't even be 10! And one looked very familiar.. but it couldn't be could it?<br /><br />An armoured fit smashed into the control panel, shattering it into a million fragments and leaving a foot deep indentation in the metal. \"MacMayer!\" growled a voice so distorted with anger it was barely human.

Despite their initial doubts, it was human, or at least humanoid. As it approached the group discerned that it was a young boy, about Morts age and height. He was wearing a light blue T-shirt and jeans and his hair was slicked back in an unusualy drab fashion. He walked oddly, more of a tired shuffle and his eyes were detached, like he wasn't focusing on anything. 'Is, is he drooling?\" said Keen slightly offput by the figures zombie like behaviour.<br /><br />The figure approached within 10 feet of the group, then stopped dead. Looking at them with his vacant stare he announced in a tired tone \"Are you Mortimer MacMayer?\" Mort stepped angrily to the front of the group. \"McMire, its McMire, and yes I am, and who the hell are you?\" The figure continued to stare ahead unblinkingly. \"I am... Harvey. Harvey v1.06. Mortimer MacMayer, I have a message for you from The Doctor.\" Mortimer snorted. \"The guy running this place? Well what is it?\" The figure raised an arm. \"I will enjoy doing to you what you did to me. Let the fun begin.\"<br /><br />\"Look out!\"<br /><br />Keen tackled Mort to the ground just as a powerful blast of energy whizzed through the space where Morts head had just been. Xky rapidly blew a hole through the creatures body which crumpled and fizzled. As the torso collapsed in a smouldering heap, both arms detached and made for him. Another shot destroyed one, and Keen quickly reached over and crushed the other in his LD50 He had to admit that for a device that covered most of his arm and could shoot through a stainless steel wall, it wasn't obtrusive, he'd almost forgot he was wearing it.<br /><br />A dull buzz distracted them from looking at the smouldering remains of the android. On the opposite side of the caverns what looked like a grainy grey cloud was emerging from several of the tunnels. Is glittered ominously in the redish light. Mort picked himself up. \"I think I know what that is, I'll bet it has thousands of independently mobile, shot capable and semi-inteligent components that are all heading straight towards us. Don't bother running, they'll get us wether or not we're in the tunnel. There's no way we can shoot them, so, any ideas?\"<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Already he could hear the ominous buzzing of a thousand rotors, see the sparkle of a thousand robotic eyes all focused on him. Facing the impossible odds, Keens true nature emerged. He was a kid, a hyper-inteligent, space travelling, planet saving genius, but still a kid, just 8 years old, and at the moment scared stiff. Whenever he'd faced life threatening situations before, there had always been a way out, someplace to dodge to, some means of attack. But not this time. All he could do was run. But to where? It was like Mort had said, there was nothing they could do.<br /><br />\"To heck wit this!\" yelled Keen over the increasing drone. \"Lets just run for the tunnel and hope we think of something!\" The drones were less than a mile away and closing fast. If they hurried they might make it to the tunnel entrance just  before the drones caught them, but that wouldn't dealay their imminent death. Suddenly Mort whirld around and grabbed Keen. \"Infared! They use infared!\" he yelled excitedly. \"Keen, use your LD50, shoot at something!\"<br /><br />Keen couldn't see the point, but shot at the cloud anyway. The LD50 gave a deafening blast, knocking Keen on his rear. The bolt of plasma streaked away, penetrating some distance into the cloud, but with no effect. \"No!\" yelled Mort \"Shoot a rock or something, and use a long blast, melt the damn stuff!\" Doing as he was told Keen let off a five second blast as a nearby lump of rock, which hissed and bubbled into magma where the blast hit. This time the recoil pushed Keen a good three feet, but it was away from the cloud, so that was okay.<br /><br />By this time Mort had resumed running. Keen followed suit, but the cloud seemed distracted, no longer heading directly towards them, more like just off to the side... \"The heat? They're after the heat?\" yelled Keen in astonishment. Then it hit him, of course, they used heat seeking IR to locate human targets! The hot rock should distract them and buy some time!<br /><br />Keen entered the tunnel panting, the droids now just behind them, but still distracted by the hot rock. He caught up with Mort, but noticed both Main and Xky were missing. Mort had paused in front of a large ventilation duct set into the tunnel side. A large rapidly spinning fan was blowing air into the tunnel with an alomost deafening whoosh. \"Where did the others go?\" yelled Keen over both the approaching drones and the buzz of the fan. <br /><br />Mort didn't reply, he simply stepped behind Keen and pushed him into the fan.<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Me is t3h m47h r0xxx0rzoen111]<br />*<br /><br />The push was unusually sudden and unusually violent, Keen was teetering forward before he knew what was happening. He felt the strong breze of the fan as hell fell toward it, felt a thud as the blade reflected off his helmet and heard a click as a piece was nipped out of the bottom of his shoe, then he was falling, headfirst down a long dark tube.<br /><br />He fell for maybe 15 seconds, trying desperately to gain some grasp on the smooth tubular walls, but to no avail. And then he reached the bottom, or more accurately, Xky's head. Fortuneately Keen had been wearing a helmet and had colided with a soft object, otherwise the fall may well have been lethal. There was a dull grey light at the tubes bottom by which Keen saw Xky neatly crumple up and collapse as he hit him.<br /><br />A few seconds later and a faint cry was heard from the tube that now lay above them. This grew louder and eventually produced Mort, travelling at some speed. Fortunately he also landed on the now prone Xky. As Mort righted himself Keen examined the room he was now occupying. It was made out of a dull grey featureless metal, with several ducts branching out of every wall, most large enough to walk down. There was a constant distant hum of machinery, and a definite wind blowing from somewhere to somewhere else.\"I don't believe this\" groaned Keen \"We're in the air vents, just like those spy films... Wait... MORT WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING??? TRYING TO GET US KILLED???!!\"<br /><br />Mort, somewhat dazed picked himself up and looked around. \"The blade caught on an inperfection on the tunnel wall and stopped for about .8 seconds every 5.3 seconds or so. You were probbably safe.\" he said a little unsteadily. \"I wonder if those droids will follow our heat signature here?\" As if in reply the sounds of metal hitting metal, and losing emenated from the shaft abone. \"Quick, move Xky!\" yelled Mort as the rattling got closer. They had no sooner dragged him off to a side shaft when the rattling became almost deafening and a hail of wrecked droid parts started to rain down into the middle of the room, where they sat smouldering and sparking in the breeze. \"Okay, they're hot, the rest of the droids will follow, then clog up the vent, we should move quick, a block air vent will eventually become noticeable.\" said Mort sternly. \"Main, you carry Xky, we can shoot our way out once we find the end of a big vent.\"<br /><br />As the rattling from the bots destruction faded into the distance Keen glared at Mort \"So you pushed me into a moving fan without telling me anything and with no idea what would happen? Why thank you Mort.\" Mort stared back \"Well, I knew you'd get past the fan, I didn't have time to tell you or anyone else for that matter, what would happen, and I figured that possible death was better than certain death, so you're welcome 314.\" he said looking offput. Keen looked away somewhat guiltily, although he didn't know why. A short while later they reached another fan which Keen removed with his LD50. Apon emerging they found themselves in a larger, but still almost featureless corridor. Flickering lights ran down the sides of it casting an odd strobe effect on the group as they discussed their situation.<br /><br />&lt;I suggest we remain where we are until Xky regains consiousness, then if we can locate a terminal I can find more accurate information on our whereabouts. However I currently believe that we are about a kilometer below our starting point at the shaft start.&gt;  suggested Main. This was taken up by the two remaining consious members who were both still a little frazzled from the recent chase. Just five minutes later Xky came to. Mort explained that he'd hit his head on the way down, and explaination accepted [somewhat reservedly] by Xky. They then proceeded down the corridor after tossing a coin to pick a direction. They only encountered the occasional impediment.<br /><br />Xky executed a perfect flip, shooting the droid in midair before landing on and crushing the small scuttling robot heading toward him. Another shot finnished the second droid. He was much more cheerful now, almost bordering on happy. \"Heh, too easy, the droid make one hell of a racket and they take ages to fire, I could Keen this up all day.\" he laughed contemptiously. Then he turned the corner and seemed to droop a bit \"Awww nuts\" was all he said as the battle droid opened fire.<br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

The entire group could see the droids now, there were three of them, about the height of a grown man. They stood on one foot and had a large plasma rifle pointing out the from the front. Without warning all three jumped toward the group, one narrowly missing landing on Keen. Jumping forward and rolling coming up to a standing start, then falling over as the LD50 on his arm unbalanced him, Keen quickly assessed the situation. Xky had rolled under and jumped up behind a droid, shot it and whirled around and promptly dodged as a blast from Keens LD50 tore the second droid in half. The dodge turned into a spinning kick knocking the third droid over. Constructed as it was there was no way it could right itself.<br /><br />Xky stepped slowly up to the stricken droid, pointed his rifle at its control canpoy and smiled. \"This program has preformed an ilegal operation and will be shut down.\" he said dryly before emptying two shots into it. The droid shuddered, then died. Xky looked around. \"there's bound to be more somewhere, I suggest we find some uneven ground, that'll make it hard for them to follow us.\" Keen took the time to look around, the hallway had ended and now branched out into a large poorly lit room. It was almost impossible to see further than 10 feet and strange mechanical noises emanated from the darkness beyond. It was going to be difficult to plan ahead, especially since no one had any idea where they were or what they were going to do.<br /><br />Suddenly a small figure emerged from the darkness, almost spherical in shape and light red, resembling a small beach ball with legs. Mort stared at it as it approached. \"Isn't that a-\"<br /><br />*scrunch*<br /><br />\"Small pile of smouldering circuitry?\" finnished Xky lifting his foot and examining the remains of the small droid he had crushed.  Keen pulled a small square box from his pants pocket, attached it to his helmet and pushed a button. Instantly the small torch lit up [or at least shifted the darkness a bit.] the large room they were in. The room was large enough for the walls to be only dimly visible. What Keen had mistaken for a large machine was revealed to be something more purposeful, a large but evidently damaged spaceship.<br /><br />It was a creamy white color, and almost a perfect egg shape. One end was dominated by a large blue viewing port through which a few simple controls could be made out. Three legs protruded from the bottom of the craft, obviously intended for landing. There was a large hole torn out of the side of the ship through which twisted pieces of metal and wire protruded. Crawling all over the ship were small spider like robots who were busy fiddling with and removing small pieces of the ship and carrying them away. Patrolling the ground beneath the ship were wheeled droids which were evidently little more than a plasma rifle on wheels, though of odd construction. They had four 'legs' connected into two pairs each of which terminated in an axel and two wheels. The droids moved by scissoring these legs. Although evidently armed, all they did was shoot anything in their patch. They could be easu=ily steeped over, or, for Xkys preference, crushed.<br /><br />Behind the ship there were row apon row of benches, many of which had complicated machinery mounted on them. There were literally hundreds of droids swarming over the equipment in fufiling some complicated but meaningful purpose. \"Is...is this some sort of lab?\" asked Keen \"Are, are they trying to build some sort of spaceship?\" Mort critically observed the craft. \"Not unless you've had more contact with the vorticons then even I knew about.\" he commented \"This looks more like a deconstruction, someone evidently wants to know how this works.\" Keen looked at the craft again. So <i>thats</i> what a Vorticon ship looked like. He made a mental note to aquire one, but it would be difficult, hiring was an option, but his Galac credit card wouldn't be any use this time. [Valid ANYWHERE in the galaxy (Excepting class 'M' planets starting with 'E')]<br /><br />The group navigated their way further into the 'lab' deftly sidestepping the rapidly moving bots, Keen [with the torch, although Mort had found his] in the lead. Suddenly Keen screamed and fell back in shock. As he fell back Mort saw what was wrong. \"Oh God.\" he stammered \"I think I'm going to be sick!\"<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

[Sure destroying the galaxy would wipe out a billion souls, but that was pushing a button not stabbing someone in the back.] So it was with a mixture of horror and fascination that he stared at the disected Vorticon lying on the labratory table. It was slit nose to tail, its skin pinned back exposing all of the internal organs. Wires and tubes projected from various organs and nerves and a variety of sharp looking robots moved over it constantly cutting and probing. Then Mort noticed what had repulsed Keen, some of the twitching wasn't due to the droids, <i>it was still alive.</i><br /><br />Xky stepped forward, grabbed a droid in a gloved hand and squezed. The droid exploded in a shower of sparks. He picked up a scalpel and needle and thread and began working rapidly and methodically at the body stopping occasionally to remove a wire or tube, or destroy another droid. Mort staggered back and tripped over the still prone Keen, he had seen something that would wake him on stormy nights for a long time to come.<br /><br />Keen shakily got to his feet and shot a worried glance at Xky. \"Is... does he know what he's doing?\" he asked worriedly. Mort gave Keen a wan smile \"Well, he was raised by dogs, and has a great knowledge of human anatomy, at least the parts that involve causing pain, so I think its in the best hands possible.\" Keen digested the statement warily. \"Really? Raised by dogs? Like those mental kids on that documentary?\" \"Yeah, he was abandonded by his mother when he was four, the authorities found him, well, adopted him from the local dog pound.\" Keen was interested, he had to be, anything to move the topic of conversation off the living dissection being preformed just meters away. \"Wow, raised on the streets by a pack of mongrels, thats gotta mess a guy up.\" \"Mongrels? Nah, it was a small pack of daschunds, he never eats hotdogs, but don't say anything will ya? He gets sensitive about it.\"<br /><br />Mort and Keen spent the next ten minutes looking at the dissected Vorticon ship Mort destroyed a lot of the dissecting droids with a strange purposefullness. Finally Xky looked up from his gruesome work. \"You, pink guy, you're carrying this thing. Any complaints and you're losing an arm, which will only make it harder. Okay everyone, I don't know where we're going, but lets damn well get there!\" The Vorticon looked worse for wear, Xky had neatly stiched it up and the Vorticons fur hid it, but it still looked like something from a zombie movie. It was breathing though and didn't look in immediate danger of dying. And so the slightly enlarged group once again set off this time more gravely and with more purpose.<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Duke steadied himself against the wall as the humming noise grew louder Trying to somehow push himself into the stonework he cautiously looked around the corner. The floating shape was slightly smaller then him and moving slowly, a good sign. He jumped out in front of it. \"Alright you ####ing piece of mehanical crap! Preper to be nuk-\"<br /><br />Suddenly he was a dozen feet away, smacked against a wall. The seated figure continued it progress down the corridor still looking intently at the figures on its screen. The last thing Duke heard before losing consiousness was a fading voice saying \"####ing vermin!

		"content": "*<br />Chapter 24: Ideas, crossovers... and p0rn!<br />*<br /><br />Keen and the others had managed to find sompleace to rest for awhile. This wasn't particularly hard as for the last hour they had wandered through various interconnected rooms. This area of the complex seemed to consist of nothing more than hundreds of empty rooms. Sometimes of course there were banks of computers or miscelaneous machinery, but apart from that everything was quiet, empty, and dead. What was worse was the fact that the vorticon had taken to occasionally whimpering like an injured puppy.They sat in the derelict room looking at the featureless grey walls and generally trying to figure a way out of this entire mess. <br /><br />\"What I don't get\" quipped Keen \"Is how the hell you knew anything about Vorticon anatomy, I mean they didn't even evolve on our planet.\" Xky smiled wryly \"If you take something living apart, you quickly realize that everything fits together like a puzzle; your lung has a dent in it to fit your heart, the intestines naturally curl up, in fact, I think the only problem it'll have when it wakes up is a crooked tail, I just couldn't seem to set it right.\" Keen shot a glance at the Vorticon, it was twitching slightly now. He was worried, Vorticons had sharp fangs and claws, and while this one looked male, and thus less violent, it would still be something to contend with if it woke up in pain and attacked the first thing it saw. Slowly Keen edged away from it until he was standing <i>just</i> behind Mort.<br /><br />Xky smacked a fist into the table. \"Well, if no one has any ideas about what to do, I say we just keep on going and nuke whatever we find. We're bound to get out of this mad maze sometime.\" Reluctantly the others agreed. As the group filed back out into the hallway Keen shot a glance at Main. It was sitting om the corner tapping at Keens computerwrist. \"Hey, are you comming or not? We need someone to carry the Vorticon.\" he said sternly. Main looked up as if startled. &lt;Yes, of course. Forgive me, your computer is still nonfunctional and I was attempting to isolate the problem.\" it said picking up the Vorticon bodily and walking out of the room.<br /><br />After traversing a few more hallways the came across a number of much larger rooms. These had a lot more and a lot louder equipment in them. Lights blinked expensively over banks and banks of computers attached to odd looking devices. It reminded Keen of Morts lab. Fortunately there were still no robots of any kind about. This equipment appeared to run itself. Interestingly there were various signs and readouts on the computer screens, all in english. \"So at least we know we're dealing with humans.\" Mort sneered. \"Now its only a matter of time before our, well, my, superior intelligence leads to their defeat.\" Keen looked at the readouts. They were in plain english, and simple to decipher. These computers were evidently meant to be used by someone of moderate intelligence as easily as possible. Obviously, no one else was meant to ever get here. Keen smiled, somehow that made him feel better. <br /><br />The various rooms held interesting projects, experimental fusion reactors, new robot versions, advanced computers, all of which Xky was in favour of destroying. Keen was tempted, but it would take to long and accomplish too little. They entered yet another room, this one labelled 'Interdimensional and probbability manipulation' Inside was yet another computer wired up to some kind of portal and...<br /><br />\"Y'know, whoever this guy is, he's real big on collecting and analysing stuff isn't he?\" commented Mort drily. There were... tanks, dozens and dozens of tanks, all cylindral, like cloning pods seen in bad sci-fi movies. Each contained something, a chunk of dirt, a tree, a piece of machinery, all sorts of random stuff. As they passed a container holding what at first looked like a badly dented wheeled dustbin it sprang to life and shouted in a voice like a cracked speaker &lt;<i>You must be ex, ex, excommunicated? Exfoliated? Error Error</i>!&gt; It attempted to do... something, but the limited space in the tube meant it couldn't do much except bump into the glass. \"Hey Keen!\" shouted Mort from across the room \"Look at this!\" As Keen walked over the dustbin managed to croak weakly &lt;<i>Wait! I have it now exterminate! Exterminte! Where are you going??&gt;</i> Mort was standing in front of a small floating red sphere. It was, Keen realized, a miniature sun. While they were admiring its beauty [And Xky was lighting a cigarette on it.] a large screen next to them lit up. <br /><br />It displayed a large polygonal green face. It leered evily at them before speaking in a digital voice &lt;<i>Foolish mammals! When I find out my location and escape from this containment program I will destroy you all!&gt;</i> Mort sighed irritably and walked up to the computers hard drive. \"Look, this has been a long day. Either you tell us all you know about this place, or...\" he moved his hand over to the keyboard \"I remove your spam filter and add you to Shocks' emailing list.\" The computer blanched. &lt;<i>Okay okay! Geez just like the other guy. All I know is this mysterious ugly looking vermin runs this place, always floating around in a chair. He's building some sort of army and this is just an experimental area, its close to the power supply though</i>.&gt; \"Well what are we waiting for?\" asked Xky miserably \"We've wasted too much time here already!\"<br /><br />Just as they were leaving Keen turned round. \"Uh, what other guy was that exactly?\" The computer continued to glare &lt;<i>The other pest that was here, he was a complete fool. He left something of his there.</i>&gt; The computer tried to indicate direction, and did rather well considering it was nothing more than a face. Keen picked up the magazine left in the corner and looked at it. \"Hmm, weird what are they...? Oh EWWWW! What?? Gah!! ....!\" Xky walked over and snatched the mag from Keens twitching hands. \"Huh, Playboy eh? Well, we certainly aren't dealing with a professional here then.\"  Mort ran over. \"Wow, what was in that? It really did Keen in! I must know!\"<br /><br />\"No, its bad for you.\"<br /><br />\"I'm bad! Let me see\"<br /><br />\"Nothing doing, you're too young.\"<br /><br />\"I command you to show me Xky!\"<br /><br />\"Oops\" said Xky 'inadvertently' tossing the magazine into the micro star [And causing it to very prettily go nova.] He pulled something from out of his shirt pocket. \"Y'know, I never thought this'd come in useful. I guess that goverment stint really did pay off.\" One brief memory erase later and the group set off [yet again] but this time at least they were no longer stuck in a myriad hallways.<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

In places water trickled down the walls and puddled on the floor. There were no longer very many computer panels and flashing lights, and those that were there were dusty and unused. What there were in abundance were huge snakelike cables,  winding across the floor, up walls and hanging from the ceiling. Slime grew in places and the group even found the corroded body of an abandonded droid, left to rust solid where it fell. But what was most unerving was the hum. It penetrated the walls, just on the verge of hearing, and yet it seemed to get louder the longer you listened to it. If you put you ear to the wall you could almost believe that the hum was emanating from the very stonework, they very building vibrated under your fingers. <br /><br />Keen paused, he was right, the hum was getting louder. Things were vibrating here. It had an oppressive tone to it, the hum wasn't exactly loud, it just made everything else... dull, like it was a wave of warm humid air pressing itself over your ears. The building <i>was</i> warmer here, and there was a draft coming from someplace. Cautiously the group edegd onward, noting that the cables had become <i>very</i> thick indeed and there was no longer any water about. There was also-<br /><br />*crik*<br /><br />*Smash!*<br /><br />\"Gah!\" yelped Keen as the heavy block smashed down where he had just been walking. Mort stood stunned just behind him gingerly touching his nose where the block had grazed it. A thick cloud of purple odd smelling 'smoke' wafted up from the floor. The group examined the shattered fragments of the block. It had large letters written on it... \"Acme?\" asked Keen incredulously. \"What is this? Some kind of sick joke?\" Xky pointed at the fragments. \"Hmmm, filled with lead crystal glass and nitrogen triiodide, explosive, heavy and dangerous. If  its a joke, you won't hear the punchline. I think I saw another passage back there lets-\"<br /><br />*Foom!*<br /><br />It was a lucky break, Mort had acted quickly enough by grabbing Xky's hand, but only Keens grabbing<i> his</i> hand stopped the both of them plummeting over the newly created pit. After a bit of struggling Xky was pulled back up to level ground. The group examined the unexpected obstacle; the entire floor had just exploded when Xky had attempted to cross it a second time. There was more iodine smoke, and the hallway behind them was now a pit filled with very sharp looking floor fragments. \"Hmmm,\" said Xky calmly \"I guess we're going forward then.\"<br /><br />\"Yeah, but we'd better be careful.\" cautioned Mort. \"You think there's morre boobytrapped floors? I think we'll be fine if we don't try to turn back.\" finnished Keen \"Nope, look at the ceiling ahead.\" Keen stared, there were a lot more blocks perched dangerously above their heads. \"Okay, like Xky said, we all go forward. Fast. Yelling, I hear that helps.\" The group dashed forward and could hear just behind them the sounds of shattering blocks... getting closer. Finally, out of breath and sure that they were about to get crushed at any moment, they turned a corner and the sounds stopped. In front of the group stood a very large door, decked with warning signs and a combination lock. The background hum was also a lot louder here now that the immediate threat of death was over. Keen smiled. \"Well, someone doesn't want us to see whats behind door number one. I'm afraid we'll have to insist.\" with that he cocked his LD50 stepped back and fired, just as Mort realizing something attempted to pull him back.<br /><br />*Bwuummmm....*<br /><br />The door didn't even make a sound as it shattered inwards under the force of the blast. All that filled the world was the hum, a throbbing pulsing almost living sound that crushed any attempt to interupt it. It seemed to penetrate their very bodies, even their pulses seemed to try and sychronize with it. A vacum sucked the head first into the room beyond.<br /><br />The first thing Keen noticed was the opressive heat, it was at least fourty degrees, the other was the  powerful wind, it whipped around the room like a miniature tornado. Which it was, for as Keen shakily got to his feet he realized that he was in a large sphereical room, about the size of a socer stadium. In the center stood a huge... thing. It was evidently the thing making the hum, the heat nad the wind. It reached from the floor to the ceiling, a massive twenty foot wide cylinder pulsing with  a strange blue light, also spinning clockwise. At its base and apex were thousands of cables as thick as a grown mans arm, along with banks and banks of heavy complicated equipment. \"This computer motif is getting old\" mumbled Xky to no avail as his words were swallowed up by the overpowering sound.<br /><br />Graduly, fighting agaist the wind, the group made their way to the cylinders' base. After much searching Mort found a single computer screen, complete with keyboard. On the glowing green screen was a number of complex readouts. Mort started typing.<br /><br />[function/]<br /><br />&lt;Power control&gt;<br /><br />[define/]<br /><br />&lt;You do not have acess, command denied&gt;<br /><br />[access]<br /><br />&lt;access denied&gt;<br /><br />[Forbid access]<br /><br />&lt;You do not have access. command denied. Access granted. Command?&gt;<br /><br />A few more miniutes of typing and Mort gave the signal that they had better leave. For Keen this was none too soon, the entire atmosphere of the place was really getting to him. Finding a door on the opposite side of the room the group quietly made their leave. Once the noise had died down Mort took no time in informing them that they had better get a long way away very quickly. They followed the passage onward, dodging more blocks and false floors. Finally they came to a hangar. It was filled with row apon row of attack droids, robots of all descriptions, thousands apon thousands of them, row after row gleaming duly in the half light projected from the distant ceiling above.<br /><br />While the group looked apon this sight in awe and shock, Keen was otherwise occupied. He was just in front of Main, and the Vorticon had woken up and bit him on the arm.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Fortunatly not only was the Vorticon not focused on holding onto Keens arm, but it had overbit so the four large fangs hadn't connected with anything. Keens shirt was torn though, and a row of toothmarks spattered with little specks of blood formed two paralell lines on both sides of his arm. The Vorticon fell back at Keens yell, dazed confused and scared, not a good state for something with five pointy ends and a tail. It scuttled under a droid with some difficulty, where it sat growling threateningly and staring at the group with frantic, half dazed eyes. It growled something in garbled Vorticon Keen couldn't quite make out.<br /><br />\"<i>Are you okay? You had quite a few injuries.\"</i> The voice came from behind Keen and spoke the sentence fluently in Vorticon, not a human approximation, or even with Keens unavoidable inability to vocalize deeper tonal growl, this was perfect Vorticon. He turned, Xky had knelt down as was calmly talking to the injured alien in an even slow voice. Soon the two of them were engaged in a cautious conversation. Keen backed off and sided up to Mort. \"He knows Vorticon?\" Mort looked at Keen perplexedly \"Its new to me, I never heard him speak a word of it to anyone.\" After a few miniutes of careful explaination the Vorticon slowly moved out from its hiding place, evidently sore from its recent dissection. It walked somewhat unsteadily towards Keen, looked at the ground and shuffled its feet a bit before mumbling in perfectly good english just loud enough to be heard, \"Errm, Sorry for biting you 'n' stff.\" The voice was hoarse, understandibly considering what the creature had gone through, but it was evident to Keen the Vorticon was extremely embarassed. \"No problem.\" replied Keen \"I'm sure it'll heal up in a few days, besides, you hardly broke the skin, although I think I'll need a new shirt.\" At the sight of Keens arm the Vorticon was first terrified, then relieved. \"Oh thank heavens. It would be terrible to have bitten off the arm of the saviour of our planet!\" Mort leaned over and whispered to Keen \"Another fan of yours 314? I swear your butt gets kissed so often you don't have to wash it.\"<br /><br />Ignoring this comment Keen turned to Xky \"Just how do you know Vorticon? You speak it like a native.\" Xky smiled \"I heard Mortimer use it occasionally when we were taking overrr... he used it a bit, it wasn't hard to learn. Besides, I have a natural talent with canid languages.\" \"Ah yeah, your upbringing.\" Keen replied before he realized what he'd just said. Xky shot him a look of surprise, shock and hatred, something very difficult to do. The Vorticon piped up \"And I learnt english after you saved our world, there's an entire summer school course for learning the language of our saviour! By the way, a classmate of mine said something to me once, but I was never taught the meaning of some of the words. I was wondering if you could tell me what is meant by-\" Keen looked at Mort who was blushing slightly, and at Xky who kept a stony impression. \"Well, uh, thats certainly an... interesting phrase. I'm, er, not quite sure how to translate it, but lets just say their mother would be shocked to hear them say that.\"<br /><br />There was a very loud silence, made by the entire group not saying anything at the tops of their voices. The Vorticon broke it after looking around at the assembled machinery. \"Excuse me, but where is my ship? And where am I?\"  Xky answered \"I explained about the general location and purpose of this place, your ship is <i>Grrr haahhhk,</i> and I'm not sure exactly where we are. Going by first impressions, I'd say that this is some kind of hangar where this robotic army is being stored. I don't think we should stay here very long, it could be very problematic for us if we are discovered.\" At this Mort jumped up as if bitten \"OMG!\" he shouted, pronouncing every letter perfectly \"The reactor! We've got to get out of here before it blows!\" Keen whirled round \"Its going to explode? How long?\" Mort, still alarmed managed to look a little more technical \"Well, I'm not sure about explode actually, or how long we have, but it <i>could</i> be very big, so we'd better be safe.\" \"Could? You mean you don't know?\" yelled Keen. \"Just what the hell did you do to it??\"<br /><br />\"Gentlemen, there's no need to fight... at least not yet.\"<br /><br />The voice was calm and measured, coming from the shadows between two helicopters amongst the thousands stored there. At first the group couldn't make out who'd spoken, they looked in confusion at the masses of deadly machinery. \"I must admit, I've looked forward to this...\" the voice had an edge to it, slightly menacing, but also snide, like a cat that had not only got the cream, but had just taken over the entire dairy products industry. A small group of oddly shaped figures moved out from the shadows into the light.<br /><br />\"KeenRush!\" chorused Xky, Mort and Keen<br /><br />\"Wait, you know him?\" they chorused again.<br /><br />KeenRush smiled, he was in his late twenties and wore a smart looking suit, much like Xky had worn when Keen had first met him. He had bright green hair combed back neatly and when he spoke you could see he'd had all his teeth filled into square shapes. At his side were three large gargs who glared at the group with barely supressed hatred, growling threateningly. KeenRush looked at the group in a mocking manner. \"Ah yes, the memories. How wonderful to see all of you here, and all in one place too. Xky, I remember growing up with you, I see you still make a living beating up those weaker than you, like that time you stole all my playgargs and spread them around the school, oh yes, I'll never forget that. Mortimer McMire too I see, the one who betrayed the Monarchist movement by selling us guard robots that didn't shoot on sight as promised, allowing both the Yorps and Keen to devestate us.

Stepping out somewhat uncertainly from it was a young man, of maybe 12 or 13 somewhat poorly dressed in a suit simalar to KeenRush's. However, unlike KeenRush this guy looked as though he had had the suit draped around him, then poorly padded. He was also wearing a pair of specs that looked as though they were going to fall off the end of his nose, red sneakers with both laces untied, and a pink shirt. He gave KeenRush an embarassed look and muttered in an unsteady voice, \"Sorry Mr Rush, err, the droids are all lined up behind them and ready to atta-\"<br /><br />At that moment several things happened at once. KeenRush gave the newcomer a look of hatred mixed with exasperation, before falling to the floor and rolling out of the way of the Vorticon, who had taken advantage of the long monolouge to sneak up behind him; The entire gruop turned around and dodged the hail of bullets being fired by the droids behind them; the two Gargs charged with one being promptly shot by Xky.<br /><br />\"Kimberly! Nooo!\"<br /><br />KeenRush screamed in rage and tackled the Vorticon so hard they both flew into the ranks of battledroids. Keen took out two droids with his LD50 annd Xky two more with his rifle. Another Garg charged Keen only to be blown away, unfortunately that had given a droid enough time to get close to him, fortunately Mort exploded it in a hail of sparks with a surprisingly accurate shot considering he was busy seeing off half a dozen droids of his own. After that things got a lot less clear, nevertheless a few seconds later all that remained of the attack force was a small heap of scrap metal, two bloodstains, and a rather fearful looking sidekick. He stared in shock and confusion at the scene around him. \"Mr Rush? Are you...?\" A clatter answered his question as the Vorticon stood up from the collapsed droids. Both its hands were bloody, and KeenRush had attempted to bite its head off, admittedly with some success, the wond was bleeding copiously. \"He is dead. Close quarters with a Vorticon is not a good thing to be in.\" it replied somewhat shakily as Xky rushed over and bandaged the wound with a pocket hankercheif.<br /><br />Mort stared at the dazed individual. \"Okay, here's the deal, either you help us or-\" \"Or what?\" challenged the former sidekick. \"Or Xky here will replace the blood our Vorticon friend has lost using you as the source. Now then, just who the hell are you and what were you doing with Mr Gargiphile over there?\" The newcomer looked at Xky terrified, who gave him an evil grin. \"I... my name is Najawa, Najawa Kinkoshai, I was learning to be an evil mastermind, its for my B.O.E [Bachelor of Evil] at Canturbry University.\" Mort appeared to reach a decision. \"Okay then, you can continue your work experience under me, just notify your supervisor of the switch, call it, death by unfortunate circumstances. Oh, by the way, if you so much as set a toe out of line I'll have Xky cut out your kidneys and serve them to you with steak sauce.\"<br /><br />Keen was nonplussed. BOE's it figured. \"Okay then, well, since we beat the badguy, I suggest we make our exit don't you?\" Mort was about to reply, but was cut off as a nearby, heavily damaged TV screen crackled into life, the image on it distorted beyond all recognition. The voice however, was undoubtedly male, mid 30's perhaps, and pi$$ed. \"Well well Mr MacMayer, it seems you just can't get a good assistant anyhere these days. Nevermind, this time you really will die. You see, I've been tracking you with my security cameras.\" The group looked up, there, hanging from a beam, was a small inconspicious camera pointed directly at them. \"so I always know where you are, and you really are in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" The two rows of droids nearest them turned on with a dull thunk. There were over twenty of them, and they would be followed by hundreds more. The voice continued cheerfully. \"I may not be able to get my revenge on you personally, but I will enjoy watching my army crush you pitiful form.\" And the screen went blank.<br /><br />\"we're screwed.\" said Keen summing up the groups feelings. However, the droids didn't move. After about thirty seconds Mort suddenly yelled \"The reactor! Run!\" As the group dashed past the comatose droids, they could already feel the ground shaking. They were too close, too slow,<br /><br />And too late.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

The walls themselves buckeld and collapsed. The explosions gathered momentum, occurring more often and rapidly approaching the fleeing group. Keen was tossed aside like a rag dool as the ground underneath him tilted and  shattered. Sharp stone fragments whizzed past him, several nicking his face and arms. Managing to pull himself up from the writhing rock Keen was just in time to see Mort transfixed by a falling block of ceiling the size of a large car. Without thinking his superhero instincts set in and Keen dove forward, knocking Mort out of the way. Both slid forward as the block collapsed on top of them. There was pitch darkness as the sounds of destruction continued around them. Keen felt something grab him, almost crushing the breath from him. Dimly he realized it was Mort, a little later he realized he was doing the same thing. When there's a pretty good chance you're soon going to become two dimensional, an arch rival is as good as anyone to hold onto and whimper. Over the sounds of the dying reactor Keen could hear Mort screaming \"AAAAH W're all gonna die! Actually die this time Flick! AIIEEEEE!!!\" Keen resisted the urge to scream, mostly because his teeth wouldn't come unstuck.<br /><br />Graduly the sounds of utter destruction ebbed and the two enemies we're left alone, in the dark, in the cramped little space between the blocks of rubble. After a few miniutes of shocked silence Keen flicked on his torch. He was in a small triangular 'room' formed by a tiled floor and two ceiling blocks that had fallen together for support. Mort was close by, a shocked look on his face. Keen realized that the both of them were bleeding, mostly from minor cuts and scratches. There were numerous holes, but none big enoug to escape from. He looked bleakly at Mort \"Well that went well. What the <i>hell</i> did you do to that reactor?\" Mort sighed \"I replaced the operating system with Windows XP.\" he blushed \"Professional. *ahem* thats why I couldn't tell what'd go wrong and when. I guess ol Bill lived up to his reputation this time eh?\" They both laughed at this, the relieved crazy laughter of those who know that if they don't the shock will get to them and they'll break down and cry. As they sat there in the meagre torchlight something from the past few miniutes nagged at the back of Keens mind, one of those little details that stands out when you know you're going to die. 'Flick?' thought Keen 'That was my nickname when...' he remembered back, back to the times when he didn't have to worry about the safety of the galaxy or alien races or being killed before lunch. 'Man, I'm 8 years old! I shouldn't have to deal with this!' he thought reflectively. <br /><br />\"Mort?\"<br /><br />\"Yeah?\"<br /><br />\"This kind of thing isn't exactly what I expected to face two years out of kindergarten.\"<br /><br />Mort turned to him and smiled weakly. \"Yeah, well me neither. But who the hell would expect this?\" They both sat in silence for another miniute or two, thinking their own private thoughts. It was Keen who spoke first. \"Where did we go wrong Grey?\" Mort recognized the use of his old nickname and smiled. \"Probbably that damn IQ test. Neither of us wanted to sit it, but I had be such a big headed twit about it.\" he sighed. \"It was just, you were Mr Popular, Billy Blaze, son of a TV star, with all the friends and everything I wanted.\" Keen was surprised at this revelation. \"Friends? Hah! With them it was all 'what 56 x 734?' or Hey Mr Dictionary, how do you speel ambivalent? You were the one with the mechanical skill, I mean, sure, I built a spaceship, you built a spacestation. Remember when you reversed Mr Perkins gravity feild? He was off 'sick' for a week!\" Both boys sat there in silence, remembering the 'good old days'; their first meeting at kindergarten, the quick friendship that had ensured when both had found out they weren't the only ones who viewed Einstein as someone whod' got pretty far for an amateur, the many pleasant days, and the arguments and disruption that had followed.\" Mort broke the silence this time.<br /><br />\"Flick?\"<br /><br />\"Yeah?\"<br /><br />\"If we keep this up, I'm going to have no choice but to be visibly sick. I say we work together and sort out this stuff later. We're gonna die right?\"<br /><br />\"That is a distinct possibility, yes.\"<br /><br />\"Then whats to stop us using that gun of yours to blast our way the heck outta here?\"<br /><br />\"The roof collapsing.\"<br /><br />\"Meh. I can handle that, remember, I taught <i>you</i> physics, this will be a sinch.\"<br /><br />After a few miniutes Mort pointed to a spot, and Keen destroyed it. This lead to a new room, which Mort quickly had a hole in, and so on. It was maybe half an hour later when they came across Najawa. He looked up in surprise at the sudden appearance of a hole in the wall. Apart from a few minor cuts and scratches he seemed to be his typical self, whatever that was. \"Mr McMire and um, other guy! Boy am I glad to see you! Can I do anything to help? Perhaps I could lick the dust off your shoe sir?\" Mort snorted. \"In this mess? Nah, save it for when we get out of this.\" Suddenly Najawa stiffened. \"Oh mna! Mr Teach is gonna <i>kill</i> me! I blew up the lab of the guy the guy I was working for was working for! I'll never get that degree now!\" Keen decided to interrupt at this point, if only to stop Najawa bursting into tears. \"Mr Teach? As in Captain Teach? He's doing evil courses now? I though I destroyed him in the cyberspider wars of Rigel 7?\" Najawa brightened \"You know him? Can I tell him I tried to kill you? Only he lost his arm in that war and it'd really help my grades if I could say that, it might even make up for my D minu minus in Namology!\" Keen paused. \"Namology?\" Mort answered \"'The discipline of proper and inventive labeling of evil devices, locations and persons.' I got an 'A' thats why 'The Grand Intellect' sounds so impressive. I'll bet his real name isn't Najawa, they usually make you change it, but whatever <i>he</i> changed it from must've been pretty pathetic.\" Najawa blushed. \"Err, its Nathan, actually. Nathan James Watterson-Kinoshi. I just used some... letters from..my name..yeah.\"<br /><br />\"But this point was missed by both Mort and Keen who were paying more attention to the scrabling noise coming from the wall opposite, even as they watched it began to crack and fall away.

Both were a little roughed up but otherwise unharmed, although Xky was clutching his left shoulder. \"I see you survived Mr McMire. I was lucky Laurael is so good at tunneling or I'd be flattened by now.\" Laurael blushed, which is quite something to see a Vorticon do. [it has to go through the fur.] \"I... I was just returning a favour.\" Keen made a quick mental calculation \"Okay, so should we risk our lives trying to get out, or should we risk them trying to find Morts AWOL computer?\"  \"Bugger it Flick, it hasn't helped us so far, if it gets out it can find us.\" As the group retreated up the tunnel Mort and Keen had blasted Najawa turned to Mort, \"By the way, who's Flick?\" Mort looked a little uneasy but recovered his composure so quickly that only Keen noticed the twitch of annoyance. \"An old friend, he always used to carry a pen he was always flicking-\" \"And I do believe,\" cut in Keen \"everyone called you Grey, because of your habit of working with stuff made out of metal and wearing a grey shirt. However, I do believe this is frivolus and if you mention it again we'll feed you to the Vorticon, they're carnivourus you know.\" Najawa visibly turned white and looked at Laurael in terror, almost tripping over as he backed away. Laurael and Xky were oblivious to this as Laurael was busy scratching at the wall making an escapee tunnel.<br /><br />A few meters of frantic digging later and the group was free of the collapsed room, or rather the collapsed portion of the room. The space they found themselves in was what remained of the hangar they had been in, behind them lay a twisted pile of metal, concrete and rock; in front of them lay further ruin; the ceiling had mostly stayed where it was, but large chunks had fallen on the collected droids. The floor was tilted at crazy angles, fragmented like a broken pane of glass. What had previously been row apon row of elite killing machines had been reduced to a smouldering pile of wreckage. The lights were barely functional, bathing the scene in an eery flickering glow, occasionally lit by the sparks of dying circuitry. And amidst it all  standing quite calmly by a shattered battledroid was Main, observing the group with an innocent gaze. \"Just how the hell did you get out of there you pink bucket of misfired cuircuitry?\" demanded Mort crossly. &lt;I can move exceptionally fast.&gt; \"So we risk our lives getting out and looking for you and you do squat to help us?\" yelled Mort incensed at the robots cold reply. &lt;Of course, I was not commanded to do otherwise.&gt; Main replied. Keen prevented Mort from destroying what he'd origionally spent months building by suggesting the y find an escape from the potentially unstable building. After some searching they found a passage that was only partially obscured by rubble. No sooner had they cleared a way and gone down it when a huge chunk of ceiling crashed down in the hangar. It was obvious that the building was now unstable, ominous creaks, groan and cracks issued from every wall.<br /><br />After several miniutes of aimless walking through the broken and flickering corridors [A task made a great deal easier by the fact that most of the walls had collapsed. It was now merely a matter of wandering in some general direction.] In the haunting atmosphere the group talked amongst  themselves to pass the time. Xky and Laurael were busy engaged in a conversation in vorticon at such a spped even Mort couldn't decipher it, Main was balantly unresponsive and Najawa was an idiot, so the conversation was mainly two way. \"So then,\" mused Keen \"We've beat whoevers running this joint without setting an eye on them. I hope we manage to find a way out of here soon, I'm hungry and my parents will worry if I'm not home by 4pm.\" Mort smirked \"Yeah? Well you've 'beaten' me enough times to know that just because it goes bang, doesn't mean its not dangerous. We should be careful, that may have been the main power supply, but anyone capable of building all this is bound to have a backup plan.\" Keen remembered something. \"Hey Mort, that screen referred to you as Mr MacMayer, that sounds like a name you'd use, can you think of anyone in your short career as an evil genius that'd be capable of this?\" Mort stopped, deep in thought.<br /><br />\"Nope.\" he said after a while \"No one at all.\"<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

There was an overpowering smell of burnt plastic and a thin mist of smoke hung in the air, stinging eyes and lungs alike. Here the walls had not crumbled so much as fused, droplets of molten metal, glass and charred plastic littered the floor and walls. All that remained of the vast amount of cables that had powered the device were inticrate webs of melted copper splattered across the walls. Every now and then a cleaning droid could be found, either futilely trying to clear the mess, aimlessley wandering under the direction of corrupted circuits or simply fused into the scenery. It was obvious that the group was heading somewhere, it just wasn't obvious wether or not it was somewhere they wanted to be. Finally the came to the hub of the machine, a large room piled with flickering and fractured screens, most of them showing static, but a few holding images of the complex. Mort pointed at a flickering screen \"Hey look, there's the mercury mine we entered in!? sure enough the screen showed to now ruined rocky visa of the mine, complete with a river of mercury with nowhere to go slowly flooding the cavern like a living mirror. Other screens showed different views, some familiar, some not. Bizzare readout spluttered from the gutted machine most of them involving large red digits. <br /><br />Obviously the computer had some sort of backup power supply as it was still functioning, but none of the views on its security system looked particularly energetic. Mort joined Keen in staring at the smoking PC. \"Well, I know this does something, but it'd be a great help if I knew what.\" he muttered. \"Keen, any ideas?\" Keen shook his head, \"It could take months to make sense out of this, and I'm not sure that this system will last this long. We may have let the villian escape, but this place is toast for sure.\" &lt;I believe I have a solution.&gt; quipped Main approaching a databank and placing a paw of it. &lt;This physical form is capable of interfacing with this system... ... ... yes, the encryption will take a few minutes to decrypt, please wait.\" With that it stood completely still, making a low humming sound. While Keen and Mort looked at each other as if to say 'well that was interesting' Laurael popped up with a small scrap of paper. \"Commander Keen? Can I have your sig-,name, whats the word... um Hggrraah? My friends will never believe that I met you when you were saving your own homeworld!\" Keen obligingly put down his autograph and a brief message in vorticon on the paper. He blushed as he did so. \"Yeah, well, I couldn't have done it without you Mort and Xky, you guys were a <i>real</i> big help.\" Laurael looked a little taken aback \"You guys?\" \"Yeah\" replied Keen \"You Xky and Mort were a real help.\" Laurael looked like bursting into tears now. \"But,.. but my name...\" she said exasperatedly. Keen clicked. \"Wait, you're female? Wow, I... I just didn't expect you know? I mean, vorticons have real odd names and...\" Laurael <i>was</i> crying now, suddenly she burst forth in a rush of semi-coherent speech interspersed with sobs, \"Waaaa! Its not my fault! I eat and eat but I never gain weight! I'm naturally diminuitive! *sob!* I've tried fire spitting, but I just can't do it! *sniff!* Its not my fault!!\" and with that she dissappeared, still sobbing, down a side passage.<br /><br />Xky turned on Keen \"You couldn't tell? She practicaly stank of female!\" Keen snapped back, \"Yeah, well not all of us have your upbringing Mr Superscent! What is she on heat too?\" Xky gave Keen a glare of anger mixed with scorn. This wasn't a cold hate, it was something personal. \"Not for at least three weeks.\" he muttered contemptiously before storming off after the fleeing Vorticon. Keen looked at Mort with a mixture of surprise, shock and disbelief. \"What did I do wrong?\" he asked weakly. Mort smiled. \"You really don't know anything about Vorticon culture, do you Flick. I must admit I didn't suspect anything either, but at least I didn't say anything.\" This just confused Keen more. \"But all I said was she looked kinda boyish.\" Mort sat down and said in a lecturing tone. \"Yes, but on vorticon it is the role of females to defend... whatever; they're larger and stronger and can spit fire. So if a vorticon looks boyish but isn't they end up getting teased and stuff, and some take that very hard. I guess she was a little sensitive.\" Keen made a note to apologize and to be more careful when talking to vorticons in future. The somewhat sombre moment was broken however when a large muscular figure burst into the room firing several shots at Mort. \"Haaah! Eat lead scum!\" yelled the figure as it launched itself toward Keen.<br /><br />Keen had to admit, Najawa was<i> fast</i>.  He hardly even saw him, all of a sudden the figure was hunced over, winded, Najawa's foot connecting with his stomach. Najawa then brought his arm around, smacking the intruder on the back of the neck and sending them sprawling forwad, their gun clattering uselessly away. As they tried pitifully to recover Najawa simply stepped over, kicked them in the crotch and placed one foot expertly on their neck, not hard enough to choke, but hard enough toindicate that this was an option. Getting over his surprise Keen took a good look at the figure; he was wearing a tattered purple shirt and jeans. Even before Najawa's attack it was evident that they were in pretty bad shape, if not bleeding. He looked up at Najawa with an expression of pure terror. \"Please don't kill me!\" he begged. Najawa kept the figure pinned. \"Yeah? Well you just tell us who you are first buddy.\" The figure pulled a small piece of paper from its pocket and scrutinized it carefully.<br /><br />\"-k-e-m; em, not um. Yeah.

Please enter command.&gt;  As it spoke all the working screens in the room flickered and went blank, the blue screen of death glowered from every one of them. Mort steeped forward, \"I want to know what this place was built for, who by and what happened.\" he commanded. Main beeped and the screens began to flicker into frentic action. A sudden noise behind them heralded the return of Xky, complete with Laurael hanging off his shoulder looking slightly upset, but not sobbing anymore. Xky looked at Keen, dislike apparent on his face, but not the rage that he had left with. He calmly approached Keen. \"Me and Laur have talked things over; I won't kill you, she understands the misunderstanding and we're all going to get on nicely. However I think its time you apologized.\" Keen did so embarassedly, then noticed their prisioner staring at the newcomers. \"Hey, nice suit!\" he said. \"I guess you're in charge huh? Look, I'm willing to do anything right? I'm with you buddy.\" Xky ignored this. \"Whats that on the computer?\" he asked. <br /><br />The screens now showed various files and pictures, plans and diagrams. Main spoke up &lt;It appears this facility was constructed by a force of advanced robots in order to construct more of said robots to be used as an army to be used to conquer Earth.&gt; \"Thats right!\" interjected Duke \"He attacked Shrapnel city just today! I was sent to dest- uh, explore the facility. I thought you were robots, thats why I shot you, honest!\" Najawa picked up Dukes gun, pointed it at the wall, and fired. A pitiful blast of green plasma emerged, moving at barely doubble walking pace and splattered against the wall, not leaving even a scratch. Najawa smirked condescendingly and pocketed the small raygun. Main continued &lt;This facility covers several dozen square kilometers and formerly contained enough technology to make the take over of earth a plausible course of action. We appear to have destroyed nearly the entire complex which is collapseing as we speak. Structural integrity will hold for approximately five hours before total collapse and destruction of facility. I have located our position and loaded a map, we may make an exit in less than half an hour.&gt;<br /><br />Keen was barely listening, suddenly something he'd almost forgotten suddenly came to the forefront of his mind. \"Shrapnel city?!! I live just north of there! What happened?!!\" Main continued in a calm voice as the monitors sprung to life. &lt;There was severe damage reported in 93% of the city, techbots were released for a thirty mile radius centered on Park avenue. Totalestimated deaths are 5560 Total...&gt; Both Mort and Keen were staring at the screens in horror now, images of smoking wreckage and body lined streets filling their vision. The entire city had been invaded, there was an army prescence, and they were winning, most of the techbots working in an uncordinated manner, but it was evident that this situation hadn't been the norm for very long. \"Main, quick, send a self destruct message to all bots now!\" yelled Keen Main responded in an infuriatingly even tone. &lt;Self distruct impossible, standby signal being sent.&gt; Immediately all the robots on the screen stood sill, the army moved in. Mort wasn't interested inthis, typing furiously at a screen that moved over the city...now closing in on a neibhourhood... now a street... and there was Keens house, with Morts just a street over. The neighbourhood itself was a mess, cars broken windows shattered, but at least there was no smoke and no bodies, maybe everyone was safe... maybe.<br /><br />Keen slumped, almost falling over, feelings of helplessness, terror, worry and relief competing for his attention. \"Well, whatevers happened, we've won, at least it's over now.\" &lt;Incorrect,&gt; continued Main &lt;There is another facility, it is operative, and ptentially more destructive.&gt;<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

		"content": "*<br />Chapter 32: A birthday tribute<br />*<br /><br />Keen stared at the pink supercomputer \"What do you mean another base? Don't tell me there's more??\" &lt;Another <i>facility</i>; it is located near Mare Tranquilitis a simalar depth underground to this one. It is equipped with a spacefaring capability rather than direct offensive and was to be used in the second phase of invasion, after this facilities armanda had eliminated ground based human resistance&gt; Keen gawped \"The moon? This base is on the moon? And this guy will know we're coming! Just great! Things can't get any worse.\" As if to disprove this last point, a dull rumbling started up accompanied by ominous creaks from the surrounding walls. Mort acted quickly: \"Main, download any and everything of use and show us the way outta here!\"<br /><br />A few miniutes later the group was running at top speed through crumbling corridors, slowly going grey as the dust ever falling from cracks in the stonework covered them like a gritty blanket. Keen had to admit they made a comical sight, Duke being prodded along by Najawa, complaining bitterly that running wasn't his strong point, Laurael was being carried by Xky like a big blue soft toy, they were following a pink bunny, and everyone was covered by so much powder they looked like a troupe of poorly dressed ghosts. Finaly they came to a rather ordinary looking elevator which beeped cheerfully when they pushed the open door button, inside was rather roomy with a huge panel on one side littered with floor numbers, going from floor 47 to 'basement' Selecting this, the doors closed with another cheerful beep and the elevator began to move. Keen noticed that almost three quarters of the floors weren't lit up, and several winked out as he watched. They made it to floor twelve before their luck ran out.<br /><br />Suddenly the elevator lurched, stopped suddenly and the lights went out. The terrible elevator muzak stopped too, but the now familiar creaking that replaced it was no more welcome.  Wasting no time Keen blasted a hole in the elevator ceiling, causing most of the occupants to fall to the floor in surprise, and Duke to huddle into a corner from which he could only be moved by a quick kick from Najawa. The elevator roof was no more inviting, almost pitch black save for the flickering light from Mort Keen and Xky's flashlights. Fortunately just off the shaft was a set of handholds leading up. \"Okay, Duke first, I don't trust him, it'll be easier to shoot him if he screws us over, and if anything goes wrong he'll be the first to know.\" said Najawa curtly. No one could see Dukes face, but his tone said it all. \"What?? I can't do that? What if I get killed?\" Najawa scowled and said in a commanding tone \"Then you'll bloody well have lived longer than you woud if you don'!\" And so the group started their 12 floor climb. After a few miniutes there was a twang, and the cable beside them whirred away. A few miniutes later there was a horrendus crash that made everyone grit their teeth. \"Well\" said Najawa with unecessary cheerfulness \"There goes the floor, if we let go we die, and there's no way to go but up.... Duke? Are you crying?\" Duke whimpered \"No.\"<br /><br />After what seemed like an eternity the reached the basement and they managed to lever the doors open. They were now in a very well furnished room, a corporate basement perhaps, where Bill Gates would hide his child porn. There was hardly any sign of damage here, but there was still no power. several flights of stairs led to yet more well furnished rooms, obviously where 'the big boss' had hung out. These were on the national grid, and well lit. \"Hey, lunch!\" exclaimed Keen eyeing a large table covered with food. \"To heck with this, we've saved Earth, the least we can do is have a snack.\" The rest of the group agreed and were soon tucking in to the buffet, especially Laurael and Duke who somehow, without saying a word, managed to challenge each other to a vigourus eating competition that only ended when both tried to simultaneously consume a chicken, apon which Duke learnt that Vorticons were a lot like blue dogs, it was never wise to take awy thier bowl before they were done.<br /><br />As they ate the building shook, and sank. By the time they were finnished they had descended two floors and were at ground level. A brisk stroll led them out of the decimated building, past several dozen body bags, and straight into an army patroll. Most of the soldiers were busy storming the building or examining the bodies Xky had created several hours earlier. However, they were paying enough attention to escort the group to their commander, a rather fat looking man wearing a neatly pressed uniform and a very serious expression. He had short neatly cut hair, and a natty little mustache, and would have looked perfectly suited to his role if it weren't for the small fact that the uniform was a WWII Kaisiers uniform, complete with the funny looking hat with a spike on it. He growled as the group approached \"My name is Commander Milt Spleen, Commander to you; now I don't know what the hell is going on here, but today has been a living hell, I have reports of entire platoons being wiped out, robot attacks, a city destroyed. Now I do know I am pi$$ed off, and whatever the hell is going on here you are going to give me a good explaination and right now because you are all decent Americian citizens and because you don't want to see what will hapen to you if you don't!\"<br /><br />Keen sighed. \"Okay, this is going to take some time to explain...\"<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

And Duke shows how \"Manly\" he is by walking through loosing at least like 4 bars of health. If I remember correctly there is a molecule at the end of the passage.

		"content": "*<br />Chapter 33: Explainments and cameos<br />*<br /><br />Before Keen could even begin to explain Duke cut in \"Special agent Duke Nukum sir! I have just completed by mission to infiltrate and destroy the enemy base; these people are prisoners and two children I rescued.\" At this remark nearly the entire group attempted protest, but Commander Spleen silenced them with one stern look. He eyed the group critically. \"Prisoners and enemy troops eh? Lets see\" he pointed a stubby finger at each of the group in turn \"Two not particularly dangerous looking men, I'll accept that; two children, very well, they may indeed be more victims of this horrid happenstance, but what else do we have here? A pink bunny? Someone dressed up as a blue dog? And the lot of you nicely coated in flour. I look forward to your report 'special agent'\" Laurael growled and insinuated loudly in perfect Vorticon that the Commander had regular carnal knowledge of Meeps, that his venomus spit would poison the baby Meeps he regularly consumed and that it was evident from his gait that he was suffering from an unusual and hard to catch sexually transmitted disease whose approximate english translation was 'licky end' The Commander listened to the alien monolouge smiling oddly. \"Very well, a forgeiner too huh? You, kid, whats your story?\" Keen was going to speak, but Mort took the initiative. Keen was impressed, it was a work of almost pure fiction, but it still reflected what had happened. There were tales about his 'uncle' Xky, a trip to the country, the mine, fights, the reactor and its 'accidental' destruction and numerous other fantasies that nonetheless painted Mort in a very heroic light. By the end of it he had drawn quite a large crowd of appreciative listeners and Duke a stopped trying to interrupt and was now observing a small grainy television showng Oprah with a look of mixed worship and love on his face.<br /><br />The Commander, now sitting on and almost crushing a small chair, mulled the conflicting stories over for several miniutes. \"Okay then, anyone else want to add anything?\" Keen couldn't resist a quick jibe \"Oh yes, we're just going off to destroy the ather remaining base of the moon.\" The commander considered things a while longer. Finally he stood up and barked some commands. \"Allright you slackers! We don't have time to lie around listening to some kid spouting crap! I'll handle this bunch of nutters personally! If they're going to the bloody moon I'll bloody well inspect their spaceships first! Now pi$$ off! Not you private Travers, you're coming with me!\" The onlookers quickly sped off in different directions, pretending to find something to do, all that was except a lanky pimpled youth who trailed along behind them. He wore large thick rimmed glasses, had a mop of messy red hair and a uniform that looked like it was hanging off him. He had a pendulous but rapid gait that suggested a puppet without strings. Not quite sure why, the group half followed, half led the commander to Morts' concealed ship hidden amongst the rocks near the remains of the facility.<br /><br />The commander looked at the definitely military looking ship, tut-tutted at the dents Keen had made that morning. Finally he turned to Mort \"This your ship?\" \"Yes\" he replied somewhat uncertainly. Teh commander prodded Mort with a fat finger so herd he almost fell over. \"Then I hope you're lucky in your attempt to blow up the other base. Frankly you have my full support, but that ship of yours looks a little too small for my liking.\" Duke gaped \"You... you can't be serious! How can you believe this group of...of... huh?\" The commander smiled malevolently \"Because Mr Nukem, they are telling the truth. Of course you will accompany them since you've already done so much. And of course the Americian army will lend its support in the form of private Ax Travers here.\" he said pointing at the lanky youth. Relieved and confused the group stuffed themselves into Morts ship, with a large amount of complaining and begging by Duke and much confused optimisim from private Travers. Just before they blasted off Commander Spleen gestured to the group \"Y'know, this reminds me of the time I worked at Roswell, picked up a nice pet dog there, sod went missing after a week though.\" and then in somewhat fractured vorticon insinuated that Lauraels family tree contained many Meeps and wondered what on Vorticon it was that the devil was using as a crotch while that most deformed diabolic area was serving as her face. Then, smiling evilly he walked off back toward the ruined building.<br /><br />As Laurael stared open mouthed at the receding figure Keen scratched his chin thoughtfully. \"Can we stop by my house? I want to pick a few things up.\"<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Keen and Mort team up to find out whats going on and Keen is introduced to Xky, Morts right hand man. They are led to a mining institute, where Xky kills ths staff, they then discover a massive underground complex and through many twists and turns where they encounter a vorticon, an evil student called Najawa, and Duke nukem. They manage to destroy the complex by blowing up the reactor and return to the surface in order to fly to the moon to destroy the remaining base.<br /><br />[And this story is less than a third finnished, ow.]<br /><br /><br /><br />*<br />Chapter 34: The pause before bloodshed<br />*<br /><br />The BWB was crowded and Keen was relieved to be able to return to and pilot his own ship, although using its acronym had caused a bit of confusion [But aren't we in the BWB already?] Unfortunately Laurael Main and Najawa had insisted on coming. [And you just can't turn down a Vorticon who can do puppydog eyes.] The stopover at Keens place was quick, he merely needed to check that his sister was still locked up and had an adequate supply of candy, to change his now quite dirty clothing and to pick up a little device he was working on. Sadly his parents were still 'out' Keen felt nagging worry gnawing at the pit of his stomach, but tried to turn it into motivation to stop the unknown menace that had cost so many so much. And so it was that less than 10 miniutes later two small ships, barely a blip against the sky headed off toward the moon. <br /><br />Keen always liked leaving Earth's atmosphere, no matter how many launches he'd been through, no matter how many planets he'd landed on, it always gave him a special thrill to see his house, then his state, then America, then the world slowly shrink away like some incredible interactive map. From space Earth looked like a little blue jewel, a small sparkling oasis of life in the harsh black void. There were many misconceptions about space travel Keen had noticed, one of them being that advanced spaceships would be able to deftly nip in and out of space in seconds. Keen had to admit he was somewhat relived to see that Morts ship, like his, had to obey the laws of physics and ascend slowly through the air, gravity pressing its passengers back into their seats as if a rhino were sitting on them. The artificial gravity helped ease things a bit, but it was still always a chore escaping a planets gravity well. And so it was that the group slowly made their way to Earths moon. The usual hyperspace transit being unsuited to such small distances, both sips had to manually maneuver to their destination, something that took quite some time, but gave Main time to pinpoint the bases exact location. It was not however without its difficulties.<br /><br />\"Laurael! Stop trying to stick your head out the window! Its a vacum out there!\"<br /><br />\"Sorry, force of habit.\"<br /><br />\"Are we there yet?\"<br /><br />\"We'll get there when we get there!\"<br /><br />\"Man I'm bored! This trip, whens it done?\"<br /><br />\"You can talk Mr DNF.\"<br /><br />Finally after what seemed a lifetime [And actually was if you were a volcano dwelling snowmeep] the approached the large grey sphere that was Earth's moon. Looking far crisper than any Earth based pictures, it loomed in front of them all dry dusty terrain and jagged craters. Keen regretted not bringing his camera, he'd never visited the moon before, and as the two ships blazed across the stunning terrain heading toward the abandonded bay where they could dock, he wished he'd brought his camera, or a printscreen button. Keen looked at the approaching crater wall, it loomed like a thick black slab, shrouded in shadow darker than a cloudy night. \"Okay, I'll lead, I have our information source. Main, just where are we headded?\" Main reached a small pink paw over and typed a few instructions on Keens tracking system, suddenly the crater was lit by bright green contour lines, a virtual map projected onto the ships viewing glass. In the center was a large red X clearly marking their intended landing sight. Laurael gasped as Keens ship suddenly passed into the crater walls shadow. All external light was instantly cut off, leaving the front of their ship completely dark and featureless. Only the dim glow of the internal lighting iluminated the passangers as they sped toward their goal. Keen hoped that Mort had been smart enough to attach a tracking signal to his ship, there was no way he'd be able to track them visually, and Keens ship was anti-radar protection.<br /><br />His silent question was answered when, as he carefully landed in the docking bay, guided only by Mains contuour projections, he saw the dim glow from Morts ship as it touched down nearby. Relieved Keen turned sternly to his passangers. \"Okay, now I'm going to depressureize the cabin, has everyone got their SEP feild generators set? Good.\" The SEP generator, one of Keens greatest inventions, worked on the cliff principle, whereapon a cartoon character can walk off a cliff on thin air, so long as they don't notice. With the SEP [Someone Elses Problem] feild switched on, the problems of zero pressure and no oxygen simply became somebody elses worry. There was a hiss as the air left the cabin, a click as the viewing glass opened and Keen found himself in pitch darkness, rapidly cut by several flashlights the group had bought. Unlike on Earth, these beams were sharp and only lit what was in front of them, a consequence of the lack of air. Mort and his passengers approached Keen. \"Very nice Flick, heck I can even communicate without a radio. So this is what you used to explore Mars eh? You're smarter than you look.\"<br /><br />In the dark Keen smiled. They knew where they were, they had a full map of the base, they knew what they were up against. \"Gentlemen,\" he said sternly. \"I think its time we gave this place a little overhaul.\"<br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

		"content": "*<br />Chapter 35: Sickening<br />*<br /><br />There was almost complete silence as the group trudged down the dark hallway, sound not carrying in the vacum that surrounded them. This time Keen had made sure to attach a tracker to his and Morts ship, and to set their defense systems on automatic, in case someone decided to put them out of commission while they were out. Although the station was meant to support only a few air breathing life forms, Main assured the group that there were copious reserves of oxygen stored in several places on the base. Aware of oxygen's more negative effects Keen decided that it would be best if they continued to use the SEP feilds rather than risk anything. With Mains digital map of the base they made rapid progress, heading directly for the bases reactor and encountering little resistance, the corridors here didn't need cleaning for dust, or to maintained very often. The entire base was draped in pitch black darkness, dead and dry and drab. Keen suddenly noticed that his arm itched where Laurael had bit him. He rolled up his sleeve and looked at the bite, it was still slightly red, but nothing more than expected, however there was a strange whitish discoloration in little spots around the wound. Odd.<br /><br />Several miniutes later Main informed them that their presence had been detected, as it inevidably would be. Unfortunately that meant that literally hundreds of droid units would be mobilized toward them. Keen had forseen this however and had made sure that everyone [Except Duke of course] was armed, with high powered rapidfire plasma pulse cannons from Morts personal stash. They'd be able to cut down the droids like a hot knife slicing butter.  They'd still have to be careful though, they'd recieve no warning, and little chance to retaliate. As such Najawa and Xky scouted ahead, sneaking around corners can ducking down like some cheesy spy movie. They were efficient though, you had to give them that, Najawa almost matched Xky's speed, seeming to flow from corner to corner, rapidly scanning the darkness smoothly and effectively. Evidently wherever he'd been trained had taught him a few things.<br /><br />Suddenly they both dodged aside, rolled and came up shooting, the plasma bullets almost invisible flashed of light blue in the airless atmosphere, the simalarly insubstantial ghostly green shots of the battle droids whizzing past at almost unobservable speed. The rest of the group caught up and opened fire. It was almost alien fighting the droids here, the shot ghost bullets without sound and exploded noiselessly without sparks, the tiny metal fragments bouncing oddly off the walls and floor like small pieces of elastic. Keen spoke up calmly, no need to shout against the resounding silence \"We'd better watch out, these guns will need recharging, they're not in an atmosphere so we'll need to repack the chambers after about 500 shots.\" Everyone made a mental note of this; it would be all to easy to run out of ammunition with this many targets.<br /><br />Xky and Najawa were shooting expertly, every bullet striking home, destroying a droid, and sometimes two. Private Ax was clumsily trying to shoot the cannon like a rifle, with little more success than Lauraels attempts. Keen wondered just whose idea it was to take those two along, and Duke was starting to become annoying too. And his arm was itching like crazy. They slowly pushed forward, ducking into side passages and hiding behind obstacles. Suddenly they came to a fork \"Half left, half right\" commanded Xky authoritively. In the rush Keen, Mort Laurael and Najawa took the left passage. It soon became clear why Xky had ordered this particular action; the passages were narrow enough so that only one good shooter was needed to protect the group and only a small number of droids could attack at one time. Najawa easily handled the now reduced attack and the group made spectacular progress toward the reactor, especially when the droids simply stopped attacking, leaving them to walk easily toward their destination unimpeded. They had been walking for maybe five miniutes when they heard the explosion.<br /><br />Xky rested against the computer bank and eftly shoved a few small keyboard fragments into his plasma canon, enough to last it another 500 rounds. He was alert now, aware that although the direct attack had stopped, this only meant that the enemy was planning a more subtle approach. He turned to Private Ax who was clumsily trying to copy Xkys deft movements with his own gun. \"So, you're whats protecting America huh? Well I don't kow about the enemy, but you sure scare me.\" Ax seemed not to notice the sarcasam. \"Yeah, I've always wanted to do something for my country. Besides, the foods good and you get paid to be told to do stuff!\" Xky smiled inwardly. It was obvious that the kid had never really fought before, and with any luck he'd never have to. He thought back over his own life, all the fighting, the deception, everything that he was and did. Maybe it was time to quit. Did he really want to be doing this in a decde? 20 years? 50? Suddenly he realized something was wrong. He'd lost focus for too long. Whirling around he was just in time to see Duke hurl something small and white at him. He dodged out of the way, yelling a warning at Ax to do the same. There was an explosion, then nothing.<br /><br />Duke stood over the two prone figures smiling evily. \"Sorry guys, but I really don't want to end up dead or something. I guess this explode-o-molar really was useful. Nevermind, I'll be sure to tell the authorities about my daring escape after your massacre by Proton...and I'll make sure they know exactly where to target the nuclear missiles.\" Ans with that he dashed down the corridor.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Laurael strode ahead, turned a corner and yelped in shock before dissapearing from view. The rest of the group rushed forward and were shocked by the sight that met their eyes. Laurael was kneeling by Xky morosely licking a wound on his shoulder in what would've been a comically doggish fashion were it a different situation. Xky was injured, a concussion, a gsh on his shoulder, but he'd live. The same couldn't be said of Private Travers who had been closer to the blast. Najawa was the first to react \"Duke! That bastard screwed us!\" He dashed back down the corridor before anyone could stop him. Xky moaned and tried unsteadily to get up. Keen had never seen him look quite so vulnerable, it was hard to act cool after just being blown up. Mort helped Xky to his feet, Laurael still hanging onto his arm, the blood on her muzzle making her look rather more menacing then usual.<br /><br />Najawa rushed back \"Wherever he went, we'll never catch him now. Lets do the respectful thing and keep going.\" with that he walked over to Ax's remains and attempted to lay them out respectfully. When he was finnished his hands were red enough for him to have done the deed himself. Harbouring more than a little repressed anger the group once again set off to accomplish their goal. Mort scowled \"If I ever see that pink shirted rat again I'll make sure there's no third time!\" his sentence was ended with a hiss. The group looked around anxiously, there couldn't be any gas leak, there was no atmosphere. \"Main, whats happeneing? Is it gas?\" queried Keen worriedly. &lt;Correct. Sensors indicate the buildup of an oxygen atmosphere in this sector.&gt; Keen and Mort blanched at the same time. \"Flick, we're really screwed now. Any chance you have something to help?\" \"Nope, no chance. Nuts, we'll have to be careful!\" Najawa looked at the pair oddly \"Oxygen? Isn't that like, good?\" Keen explained \"Doubble the oxygen concentration, quadruple the combustion speed, anything, even a hot pipe could set your clothes, and you on fire. Anything will burn now, we can't use our guns, too risky... and if we don't get out of here soon we'll get oxygen poisoning, go crazy and then blind.\"<br /><br />Already the group could feel a gentle breze as pressure was restored, and normal sounds started to pass through the thickening air. The hallways however remained as pitch black as ever, but better lit now by the flashlights the group carried. The air of menace was gone, replaced by a strange lighthearted feeling. Xky straightened his clothing and adopted his traditional aloof appearance. Only Keen and Mort were aware that this was the first symptom of oxygen poisoning. Tehy could run much faster now, it was as if they simply couldn't grow tired. But that was another risk, too much exercise would accelerate the poisoning, and could dangerously raise their body temperature. Keen also concentrated more on his arm, it really was itching like crazy now. An examination showed why. \"Uh, Laurael? Vorticons don't carry any saliva borne infectious diseases do they? Because um, I'm worried about this.\" Keen showed the group his arm; small blue spots had appeared around the area where Laurael had bit him. Mort spoke up before the Vorticon could reply. \"Shouldn't worry about it Flick, its just vortipox, most vorticons get it sometime during their lives, I guess she'd just recovered. You'll be covered in an itching rash, nose'll run and general unpleasantness, but you'll be fine in a day or two.\" Keen looked at Laurael, who nodded. Noticing something, Keen paused \"Has anyone looked at themselves in a mirror lately? Because we're starting to look more and more like the doom squad each miniute.\" Confused the group members stared at themselves. Najawa had bloody hands, Xky bloody everything and torn clothing, and Laurael looked like she'd just disemboweled a small furry animal. <br /><br />The realization of this caused several miniutes of uncontrolled laughter, accentuated by the high oxgen content, right up until the doors closed in front of them.<br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

They proceeded along their new course, Main predictably informing them that they were getting further away from their target, There was a sense of worry permeating the group now, everyone knew that the future wasn't going to be pleasant, but they kept going anyway. Keen looked at the small SEP generator on his wrist, it looked like a small black metal bracelet. \"Okay everyone, power down your SEP generators, see the dial? Set it so that the blue light is on.\"  The group did as they were told, one nagging question in their minds. (Simultaneously a young Americian boy in the intensive care unit of Brookland Hospital suddenly stopped believing he was being asphyxiated several times at once and that he had a full bladder.)<br /><br />\"I know what you're all going to ask, go ahead.\" sighed Keen. Najawa was the first to voice their concern \"I though this field was a free ticket to immortality? Why are we so ****ing screwed?\" Keen took a deep breath, this would take a lot of inventive metaphors to explain \"Basically this feild is ignorance based.\" Deafening silence. \"What that means is its very good at shielding against things that you can easily ignore.\" Still silence. \"Like in poorly written sci-fi's? Where the hero can easily accelerate to light speed without being crushed, but the deadly gas being pumped into the room can kill them? Same here, being shot at is hard to ignore, as is oxygen poisoning. They're all set on standby, so if we encounter anything ignorable they'll activate and shield us.\" He paused, this time the silence was one of anticipation \"Erm, Najawa, is it just me or did your attempt at swearing actually involve bleeping?\" Najawa looked solem \"Mother always said never to swear.\" Mort surpressed a snigger \"You're an evil henchman and you don't swear? No wonder you were failing your classes.\" Najawa looked hurt \"I don't see why I need to swear, you never hear henchmen in movies swear.\" \"But actual bleeping? How the frell did you manage that?\" said Keen in awe. <br /><br />\"Oh that ****ing easy, people think its ***ing hard to do the ****ers\" Najawa replied, each word a perfect bleep as if his speech had been overwritten by a TV censor. \"Besides, I know plenty of swearwords; fudge, frell, damn, drat, arsloch, and Vorticon too! Verrgriss! Wrrgrawwny! Rrrggh H'grraagh 'K'rrrggh!\" There was a muffled 'Meep' from Laurael at this point and everyone noticed she'd turned pale (Difficult for a vorticon to do through all that fur.) Xky chortled under his breath, his serious demeanour increasingly succumbing under the pressures of oxygen poisoning. \"Heh, that was quite an... interesting description of what I suppose might just be physically possible if you were to dislocate someone's leg, but I suspect only Vorticons would have a snout long enough to try that with.\"<br /><br />Keen decided to cut the rather interesting train of thought off before Xky decided on a demonstration. The corridor was changing here; the darkness made it hard to see how, but there was definitely something up ahead. Keen boldly strode forward egar to meet fate. \"Okay lets see what we have h- woo-woo-woooahaaaa!

		"content": "*<br />Chapter 38: Slipping descent<br />*<br /><br />Keen tripped and landed on his rear, continuing to slide one the almost frictionless ice that had suddenly replaced the floor. He stopped only when he colided with a wall of solid ice a few dozen meters further along. The cold hit him like a fog, suddenly his breath steamed in the air. Behind him he could hear the whispered conversation of his peers, then a whoop and the sound of someone rushing forward. He managed to shakily get up onto his knees before Laurael barking excitedly and dragging Xky behind her, hit him at full speed. A while later he was helped out of the heap of tangled bodies by Mort who was holding onto Najawa, both leaning away from each other in order to afford them both some means of stability. After several comical slip-ups, and more insane laughing from the group, everyonne had aquired a partner and were attempting to imitate Mort and Najawa's somewhat shaky positions. With Laurael and Xky this was made almost impossible, as both had a severe case of the giggles, an effect of the oxygen poisoning Keen reasoned. He himself had developed an increasingly severe headache, and the itching on his arm now covered the whole limb and his nose was running. He looked at the pink robotic rabbit he was partnered with 'Man, if I weren't here, I'd never believe I was holding hands with a supercomputer rabbit in an underground lunar ice chamber while saving the world. I'm gonna need <i>years</i> of therapy for this.' With an almost deafening whoop Laurael pushed herself off a wall, spinning herself and Xky wildly round before they both colapsed. Again. 'Decades.' Keen corrected himself.<br /><br />A while later the group had sumarised their position. There was no way they could go back, and Main had found an alternate route to the lunar reactor. On enquiry of their location Main had informed them that they were in an overhang of the crater they had entered through, a place where no sunlight fell and comet ice had built up and was being mined for its oxygen content. Keen and Mort had both realized why they had been herded here; not only were they close to space, and thus could be ejected, but the low temperatures would quickly cause their oxygen fueled bodies to waste all their energy, potential death in less than half an hour. It seemed the entire group was suffering, both Mort and Keen had headaches and dizzy spells, Xky and Laurael were becoming increasingly incoherent and even Main seemed worried. The only person (seemingly) unaffected was Najawa, but given the length of time they'd known him, it was entirely possible his current behaviour was exceedingly unusual for him.<br /><br />Thier best bet was to split up and try and find an exit, all three pairs staying in contact via their SEP generators. Keen had his doubts with this course of action though, while he and Mort were certainly capable, Xky was almost totally unable to hold a line of thought. (He was currently in hysterics because Laurael was demonstrating her ability to wag her tail both up and own and in circles. [Something very few Vorticons can actually manage, and an enviable skill by the way.]) As Keen watched them both slide off with a mixture of surprisingly good ice skating and uncontrolled fits of laughter he had a bad feeling that in their current state they'd fall down a precipice, or do something worse. And the moonscape certainly looked dangerous, the hallway had given way to an icy cave filled with jagged fragments of ice, sharp as glass. Several large black machines worked at the frosty rock faces, pumping subzero liquid oxygen and hydrogen out of one prt, and a burning flame from the other. At least the ice was less slippery here, but the air was colder, and any pause resulted in their feet sticking to the ground. Keen sighed and proceeded, with his somewhat unusual partner, to search for a way out.<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />\"Hehehe! Told ya you shouldn't\"<br /><br />\"Ith not funny!\"<br /><br />\"Heh heh, old inuit sayong, never put your tounge on a glacier!

Here was what he wanted; a spaceship. A way to get off this acused rock, and away from that insane group of... of... things. It was sleek and so jet black it could only be seen by the way it cut off the beam of Dukes' flashlight. It took some climbing, but Duke eventually made it into the cockpit, large enough to play a game of tennis and very well furnished. Duke smiled and sat down on a padded velvet chair in the center of the room. He analyzed the complex controls for a miniute before pushing the large red button marked 'On' The large viewing screen in front of Duke lit up with letters a foot high. Duke studied the complex multi-sylablic words for a few miniutes, trying to glean some meaning from them. \"Sys-tem in-con-plete.\" he muttered. \"N Pre-dic-ted launch time...\"<br /><br />\"When its done?\"<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Keen twisted, missing the sharp shrad of ice by a few inches. The entire cavern was covered with broken glassy fragments, and the mining machines occasionally froze, sending dozens of deadly splinters into the air. With main as his guide they were scanning the local area for escape routes, they low temperature no longer a problem, but Keen was feeling worse by the second. This was not good, he could barely concentrate. And they were taking exceedingly long pauses which Main assured him were due to oxidative stress on his system. Keen doubted this as Main seemed to be in full possession of his processing facilities, and wouldn't let him see what he did during such 'breaks' He'd had his suspicions before and had been watching Main like a hawk. Now they needed all the help they could get, if that computer was trying anything, it'd have to be dealt with now.<br /><br />At the next break Keen kneeled down and snuck after Main, he didn't go far before sitting down and fiddling with Keens wristwatch. \"So, do you mind telling me just what you've been doing with my wristwatch computer all this time Mr Supercomputer? I'd be very interested in your explaination.\" Keen said, pronouncing each word with ice cold seriousness. The robot practically jumped. It wore what Keen swore was a worried expression. &lt;The high oxygen levels are damaging her system. If they continue she will shut down.&gt; Keen paused, trying to figure out just what the heck that statement meant. Then it dawned on him \"Wait... my wristwatch is female now? Just what the heck did you do?\" Main gave Keen an almost surprised look. &lt;I didn't do anything, she was constructed female as a result of your programming formats. Please, you must no of some solution. I love her, we cannot be seperated.&gt;<br /><br />Keen sat down. \"Okay... what the <i>hell</i>? You've gotta be kidding me. This is the most-\" Keens wristwatch cut him off with a brief series of beeps declaring her mutual love for Main, the fact that she was severly injured and a request for help. Even as Keen desperately tried to comprehend the situation he couldn't help but be impressed that he'd built a device that could communicate so much emotion in a 15 second series of beeps. He sighed. \"Look, I just can't deal with this right now. I don't care whatever it is you...two are doing, I'll sort that out later, but right now I-\" A loud crackle from his SEP transmitter cut him off. \"Uh, Commander Keen?\" It was Laurael \"Yeah\" Keen replied casually .<br /><br />\"Uh, somethings wrong with Xky.\"<br /><br />\"Yeah? Like what?\"<br /><br />\"Uh, he can't walk and he's giggling a lot and um, I'm feeling real dizzy too.\"<br /><br />Keen swore under his breath. Great, just great! Now they were in real troubble, people could die any miniute! He wracked his brains for an idea. Get him to hold his breath? No. Breathe into a bag, nope. Damn it! Suddenly he had an idea. \"Main, can you locate for me the point closest to the vacum of space in this room? After a few second Main indicated an area of wall a few hundred meters away. Keen steeled himself, then, hoping he wouldn't set himself on fire removed the sonic grenade from his pocket. \"Okay, everyone listen up; I want everyone to grab onto something solid and think happy thoughts, don't ask questions, just do it. And don't clench your teeth!\" Before he'd spoken the last words he'd set and thrown the small spheroid at his imagined target. The last thing he heard as he hurled himself to the gound and grabbed onto an ice boulder was a crackly conversation through his transmitter. \"Something solid! Something <i>solid!</i> Laurael get off of me!\"<br /><br />And the the world turned inside out.<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

There was a silent pause, as if the whole world were holding its breath, then it shattered. An almost visible shockwave punched through the wall and the air surrounding it. The wall shattered like so much glass as the shockwave tore through it. On the other side was nothing but the crisp vacuum of space. Keen shut his eyes as the shockwave neared, praying that the vacuum of space would keep the millions of fragments of ice from touching him. There was an odd sensation as the shock hit, an almost audible 'smoosh' above the deafening racket. Instantly the SEP field saved his hearing, and the fact that he had his jaw slack stopped his teeth shattering like sugar glass. Keen struggled to keep a grip on the rock he was holding, but after the wavefront had crushed him forwards, the vacuum of space pulled him back.<br /><br />The almost inaudible crushing pressure of the soundwave gave way to the whistling roaring suction of a hungry vacuum. Almost instantly Keen was sucked horizontal, buffeted by the winds suctioning out of various entry passages and pummeled by ice, machinery and anything that wasn't securely fastened down. Suddenly the boulder Keen was hanging onto shifted, then flew into the air, shaking Keen off like a rag doll. As he tumbled in the air currents, smacked on all sides by carried debris he saw a pink blur as Main was similarly affected. In his ears he could just hear Mort and Najawa yelling, further away from the impact and safer. The walls whirled past in seconds and Keen was sucked into the endless vacuum of space.<br /><br />Xky looked at his legs and willed them to move. He focused all his mental energy of the precise sequence of movements needed to bring him to a crawling position. His body rewarded him with a few clumsy shakes and an uncontrollable burst of laughter. Mentally Xky cursed. He was in complete control of his mind! Why couldn't he talk or move the way he wanted? It was like his brain was padded in pink cotton wool, nothing was working, even the meditation and mind focusing techniques he'd spent years perfecting. He gave up. So this was it was it? This was how it would end, killed by an invisible enemy by a process he barely understood, dying alone in some abandoned base on the moon. And worse, dying an unknown <i>hero</i> for chrissake! What would the De Ville academy think of its most successful graduate now? Things were getting foggier now, he could think, but it was hard to keep the train of thought on the rails.<br /><br />He didn't remember what his mother had looked like, or when he'd been abandoned. All there ever was were the faces of the pack looking up at him. He'd always been the runt, despite being larger than any of his siblings. And then the man from the academy had come, and been severely mauled, and he hadn't looked back since. What were they up to now? he wondered, especially Spike, for a daschund he'd been unexpectedly tough. Apparently he was working in the security division of an automobile wrecking site. Too late now he thought numbly.<br /><br />*<br /><br />He became dimly aware of a figure nuzzling him, focusing he became aware that it was a vorticon, called Laurael. He tried to rouse himself enough to tell her to let him die, but all he could get out was a mumble. Laurael  knelt over him looking extremely worried. \"Xky? Xky? There's a hissing noise coming from somewhere and its getting all windy in here.\" Xky managed to pull himself sluggishly into a sitting position. \"Great, if we don't do anything its possible that we'll die sooner.\" Laurael appeared not to listen and tried to drag him to the far end of the cavern they were in. \"I'm not going to let you die  Xky, not after you didn't let me die.\" Xky frowned \"Believe me, I've let plenty of others perish, and saving your life is no need to feel sorry for me.\"<br /><br />Laurael leant over and gave Xky a lick. A rather clumsy, hesitant lick, but Xky didn't need to be Vorticon to figure out the intention. He sat back, lost for words. He had to admit she'd been acting quite friendly recently, but he'd put that down to the oxygen. Thinking back, there had been some attraction, flirting even, on his part, but he'd ignored it, it just didn't seem right. After all, she was not only another species, but from another planet. On the other hand... Xky leant forward and tried his best to return the lick. They were both blushing now, unsure of what to say, or do, next. Laurael made the first attempt at resolution by sitting down and nuzzling next to Xky. \"Are you sure this is alright?\" Xky looked the blue furred alien in the eyes. He'd never noticed she had purple irises before. \"Sure, after all, we'll be dead in ten minutes.\" They embraced, there was a crackle from Xky's SEP transmitter. \"Ah screw them.\" he mumbled. After that neither said anything for quite a lot longer than ten minutes.<br /><br />*<br /><br />Keen looked morosely at the moonscape spinning below him, gradually growing more distant, the force from his expulsion exceeding the moons escape velocity. A few hundred meters away Main tumbled along on a similar orbit. He tried to contact the others through his SEP transmitter, but all he got was static. He was alone, and rapidly losing any chance of making it back alive. And the SEP field wouldn't last forever. \"Just great.\" he mumbled looking at the abyss that confronted him. \"Why do these things always happen to me?\"<br /><br /><br /><br />[Any complaints PM to me and I'll forward them to Sarah directly.

Sarah has written more, but that won't appear for a while...<br /><br />*<br />Chapter 41: Recovery<br />*<br /><br />Mort slowly pulled himself up of the ground. Something subtle hinted at what had just happened. The wind had almost died down completely, and the sharp shadows and silence was back. Najawa was nearby, flat on his back and kicking wildly. For a moment Mort thought he'd been concussed until he realized that the loss of pressure had caused the thin layer of moisture on the ice to freze instantly and the Najawa was now glued to the floor very securely. \"Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!\" Najawa moaned. Mort sighed. \"Just take off your coat. Now c'mon, we've got to find the others quick sharp, especially Keen, he's the only one with the way out.\"<br /><br />Keen wondered just what the others were doing, and how long he had to survive. He'd managed to grasp a small rock on the way out, but the moon was now a dizzying distance below him, and his momentum was not decreasing at any measurable rate. 'I wonder if I'll become an earth crossing asteroid?' he wondered 'It'd be ironic if some kid were inspired to take to the stars because of my incandescent remains.' he remembered back, back to when he first looked up at the sky and- &lt;Inumerable thanks Mr Blaze! She is now functioning perfectly!&gt; interjected Main, ruining a perfectly good bout of flashbacking and character development. \"Yes, well I'm glad you're happy, now about the small problem of us spinning off into space hmmm?\" Main floated into view, lazily reaching out and connecting with Keens boulder. \"Hang on, just how did you get all the way over here?\"<br /><br />Mort pattered slowly down the corridor following the tracker in the SEP generator. \"Man, if Flick ever invented anything worthwhile, these are it. I may just have to steal the design. Pity about the poor bastard whose getting my asphyixiation.\" He noticed Najawa had fallen behind. \"Wait, you mean someone else gets killed instead of us?\" he asked uncertainly. Mort tried to remember Keens rather complex explaination \"Nah, it kinda spreads out, usually over several hubdred receptive minds, they only feel a little uncomfortable, and even if it were only one person they wouldn't die, just think they were. Remember, its someone <i>elses'</i> problem. Of course, you do get resconance effects, someone could pick up several signals at once, poor sucker. Or you could focus the feild.\" Najawa was intriuged. \"Focus the field? How so?\" \"Ah, just think of someone and wish they had your problems, easy.\"<br /><br />Keen pushed off another boulder, this one studded with machine parts. The Moon was a lot closer, and he was falling fast. Why hadn't he thought of it? Simply pushing off whatever he was touching! Consevation of momentum would do the rest! Of course, now he was rapidly accelerating toward certain doom, but that was a problem he'd deal with at a later date... a rapidly approaching later date...<br /><br />*Meanwhile on Earth, De Ville Academy...*<br /><br />Harvey Beta stood before the crowded lecture hall. In front of him was an intimidating array of computers and projectors, and in front of them his teachers and peers. This was a big day, a big day indeed. He cracked his knuckles, a sound that echoed through the entire hall, silencing those present. Harvey had a lot of knuckle to crack. He had a lot of anything to do anything, as could be attested by the fact that he was majoring in thuggery and henchmanship. His final presentation would assure him his degree and kickstart his career as an international lackey. Clearing his throat, he began. \"Ladies and Gentlemen... and Daschunds. I stand before you to give my final presentation on 'humiliation and persecution of an individual resulting in mental harm.' The subject is one Nathan Watterson-Kinoshi, whom I have persecuted and humiliated until they suffered a total nervous breakdown resultin in him thinking he was a hummingbird.\" The first movie appeared on the projector, accompanied by laughter and applause. This was just the start, there were better pictures to come. \"Now, I'll begin with an explaination of my use of pink fluffy soft toys and mash notes as a means of peer reject... reject...\" suddenly Harvey collapsed, clutching his throat. The auidience acted quickly, poisonings not being unusual, especially those involving such successful students as Mr Beta.<br /><br />Amidst the choas two faces watched the scene calmly. One was doctor Kaos [Professor of Random Destruction, BRDest] the other was considerably lower down and furrier. <br /><br />\"Hmmm, Mr Rauh, certainly not one of my students, although the performance is admirable. Rather reminiscent of your brothers elimination of competitors no?\"<br /><br />\"Bark!\"<br /><br />\"Yes, I thought so too.\"<br /><br /><br />*Back to the lunar station...*<br /><br />Xky stared up at the ceiling, listening to the almost inaudible hiss of the SEP field competing with the sound of the blood rushing through his ears. He was feeling rather numb, his mind slowly getting back in line and the events of the last hour slowly settling into his memory. \"Well, I don't think we're going to die anytime soon.\" he said lamely in Vorticon. Laurael sat in the corner trying to avoid eye contact. \"Ummm, does this change anything?\" she mumbled. Xky sighed. \"I... I just don't know, I'll need to do some... thinking.\" The embarassed silence was broken by the prompt entrnce of Mort and Najawa. \"Alright you two, we've got to find Keen pronto, so no lazing about, you end up sticking to the floor.\" commanded Mort authoritively. The two prone figures fell into line as Mort consulted the tracker. \"Okay, he's about a mile from here, and moving... Xky, when did you put your shirt on backwards? And what happened to your trenchcoat? I've never seen it look so ragged since that stint in Vietnam. Was there some kind of attack?\" Before anyone could answer Mort gasped \"Oh crap!

The moons gravity had him now and if this was earth he'd be able to feel the wind rushing past. You had to admit, it was picturesqe though, better than any of the lunar maps sold in stores or on the next, his very own Google Moon, graduly focusing on his imminent destruction. It was just like the movies, the ground rushing up ever faster until it blurred by so fast you couldn't think-<br /><br />*smack*<br /><br />Najawa hit the panel squarely, sending it flying across the room soundlessly. \"Uh, Naj, just why did you do that? Did the panel insult your mother?\" asked Mort drily. Najawa shrugged \"I dunno, I just thought that this story could use a nice literary reslove, y'know, considering Keens just hit the moons suracfe, it'd be neat to link two paragraphs...\" There was an akward silence as the fourth wall rebuilt itself. \"Ooookay, just what the hell are you talking about? And... dear lord! You're right! Keens hit the surface, and he isn't moving anymore! Keen, Keen can you hear me? Flick? Hello?\" There was no response, the distant fuzz of static filling everyones' transmitters. Mort tried again a few times, ever more desperately to contact Keen, but to no avail. They did however get a transmission from Main, who had survived it explained, due to the rather low density, his relative tolerance to damage and a fortuitous pile of dust. \"Well, I guess we go pick up Main, and find a way toward the reactor.\" mumbled Mort somberly.<br /><br />They reenterd the cavern they had left just miniutes ago. Many of the machines were broken, most of the derbis cleared away by the explosion that had left the painful gash in one of the wall that let the harsh blackness of space into the wounded base. The ice wasn't slippery anymore and there was no longer the sound of heavy machinery. That which remained working in silence, their lights the only thing iluminating the dark expanse. In the corner a damaged machine shot a jet of oxygen pointlessly into space. Just over the fractured wall appeared Main, climbing oddly over a slab of ice the size of a tennis court. &lt;Despite recent events I have located a new pathway to the reactor. It is advised we hurry as I suspect that our opponents will now attempt physical elimination since the damaging atmosphere has been drained.&gt; he advised. The group was already halfway across the cavern when Najawa noticed someone was missing. \"Hey,\" he asked quietly \"Where's Mort?\"<br /><br />They found him climbing over the shrapnel that remained of the wall, heading out across the lunar landscape, the walls of ice and rock that formed the crater looming above him, seemingly oblivious to all else, as if he planned to walk off and let the darkness swallow him. Xky held the others back. \"I know him best, you lot regroup inside, as it were and wait for our return.\" he advised. Najawa, eager to do more brown nosing objected. \"What? Leave you to alone? You're crazy! What if you're plotting my death?\" he complained. Xky turned to face him and gave him one of his famous stern looks. \"In that case you'll live a little longer then you will if you keep up this behaviour.\" he said icily. Suddenly the crater seemed just a little darker, a little more cold. The group backed off.<br /><br />By the time Xky had caught up, Mort had mounted one of the radial ridges crossing the crater and stood looking over a dusty grey expanse, the location Xky noticed by checking his transmitter, of Keens remains. Fortunately the impact seemed to have left little sign of the event, the ground even on the ridge being coated with almost an inch of powdered rock, the result of millions of years of micrometeorite impacts. Xky looked over at his boss who now seemed a lot smaller, more like the 8-year old he was than the mastermind of a criminal empire. To his surprise, Mort appeared on the edge of tears. \"Boss?Are you alright?\" asked Xky carefully, being more formal then he had in years. \"I... I thought he was your archnemesis... I know he helped but...\" he trailed off. Mort sighed despondently. \"Yes, I know, I should be ecstatic, the whole mad cackle and everything, after all, how many evil geniuses get to outlive the hero? But... but I just never actually thought this day'd happen, and if it did, I thought I'd be the one to do the job, the whole big finale final boss showdown. Its hard to explain.\"<br /><br />Both were quiet for some time before Xky spoke. \"Yes, I see... you were partially defined by your opposite. Everyone has to push against something, and now you don't have any idea what to do next, who to fight or what to do. At times like this I think you should remember the Kenedy Constant.\" Mort tunred \"And whats that Xky, whats that?\" Xky smiled evily as he replied \"Don't get mad, get even.\"<br /><br />Silence swallowed the pair again, locking them into a noiseless lightless world. When Mort next spoke it was a voice of command, one Xky had heard often over the years. \"Very well then, lets.\"<br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Najawa tried to figure out the proper emotion for the occassion, technically Laurael was now the only non-villian in the group, but everyone else seemed pretty upset by Keens death. He decided to stick with a sombre tone. \"Yeah, I'm afraid so.\" Laurael bared her teeth and tapped on them thoughtfully with an extended claw. \"This is the tooth I bit him with, I shall never brush it again in his honour.\" she said patriotically. Despite the obvious consequences of this action nobody said anything. A symbolic gesture was a symbolic gesture, no matter how unhygenic.<br /><br />The group walked in silence for a short whie until Najawa noticed something that had been nagging at his mind for some time. \"Uh, Mr Rauh, you're sholders turned blue.\" And indeed it had. The skin surrounding the blast wound he had recieved earlier had aquired the bluish tint of Vortipox. As had other areas. \"Is that a scratch on your neck?\" asked Mort curiously \"And it seems to have spread to your arms as well, roll up your trouser leg.... thought so. Huh, you must be susecptible to it or something.\" Xky observed his new tinting. \"Yeah, well, if someone hadn't tried to clean my wound I'd be fine.\" he mumbled. Laurael twirled round with lightning speed at this comment. \"Oh? And I suppose getting a small ilness is worse then having it get infected with gangrene and your arm falling off? Look at it! Have you even done anything since I helped? How is it supposed to heal if you don't lick it?\" she advanced on Xky \"Oh look, you'll never reach it with that tounge of yours. And stop struggling, its for your own good.\" The group watched in amusement as Xky was backed against the wall futiley protesting his cleanliness, about which Laurael had quite a lot to say. \"And look, *lick* yes I thought so, I can tell what you had for breakfast this morning, eggs. What would your mother say? <i>Hold still</i>, egg is <i>very</i> hard to remove. Now try and keep cleaner will you? Its disgraceful!\" And with that the group moved on, one member quite a bit cleaner and deciding not to mention the fact that he'd had eggs for lunch the previous day.<br /><br />*Meanwhile in the <i>real</i> middle of nowhere...*<br /><br />Keen felt the cold on his face, or rather he thought the cold, feeling being something associated with bodies. He got up onto his knees and looked curiously at the fine black sand he was standing on, each grain twinking like a miniature prisim of obsidian. The sand formed dunes, and the dunes a desert. The horizion was flat, Keen noticed, the desert went on forever. He looked up, the sky above was pitch black cold colorless stars twinkling joylessly like grains of salt sprinkled on the blackest tablecloth ever. Yet he could see clearly, even though there was no obvious source of ilumination. A strange purple rainbow glinted off all edges and objects though. It was perfectly still, perfectly silent, perfectly... \"DEAD?\" It was a voice, yet not one. It seemed to enter his mind directly, bypassing his ears. It also sounded like its speaker had a lead throat. Keen turned, trying to pinpoint the source of the voice.<br /><br />\"Ah, um... so I'm going to die then?\" he said weakly. \"MOST ASSUREDLY.\" replied Death in tones of corpses being piled onto a plauge wagon. He was about seven feet in height, yellowed bone in a night black robe, a lesson in skeletal anatomy. He did however, Keen noticed, have two very bright blue points of light, like miniature supernovae in his eye sockets, staring out at the world like holes into another universe. \"Uh, given my imminent death, why am I not terrified, or upset... or anything?\" asked Keen, his curiosity growing by the second. \"SUCH EMOTIONS USUALLY REQUIRE A BODY AND GLANDS TO FELL. THIS IS A PLACE OF THOUGHT AND REFLECTION\" replied Death cooly. \"So my whole life flashes before my eyes, complete with commentary and judgement?\" \"OH YES, JUST BEFORE YOU ARRIVED.\"<br /><br />Keen sighed, or maybe he though about sighing, it was hard to tell. \"Well then, we may as well get this over and done with.\" he said resolvedly. \"YES,\" replied Death, removing a piece of curling yelloed parchment from the recesses of his robe. \"LETS.\"<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

		"content": "Death used to shun quotatin marks until he realised that people couldn't tell the difference between his talking and the narrative. He doesn't like using them, but as he himself says \"OH WELL, TAHTS LIFE.\"<br /><br />*<br />Chapter 44: Trinity<br />*<br /><br />As the group moved toward their destination under Mains instructions they became aware of the familiar indications of the approaching power plant; the arm thick cables, the dull hum, the fact that the very walls seemed to be vibrating with a pulsed engery. They were, according to Main, less than 2 miles from the reactor core, and closing. Although they were so close, as yet there had been no further attacks. They advanced cautiously, Xky scouting ahead and Najawa protecting the rear. SLowly they progressed through the ominously empty corridors, until finally they came to the expected large, reinforced door.  Worryingly it wasn't locked, on the control panel a single message blinked in plain english; *come on in!*<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Duke cursed as the ship took another random veer, throwing him against the back of his chair. Damnit! He'd managed to find another ship, one that worked, but is a far cry from anything he was used to flying. It was a mutated oval shape, like an unbent boomerang. Its controls were alien, as were the three red freckled green beings tied up in the back compartment. For aliens they'd spoken very good english, something Duke didn't worry about as he fought to keep the ship under control. Given that often he had troubble with devices more complicated then buttons, [Zips on <i>all</i> my clothing? yeah baby!] this was proving unsuccessful. It did however create a convincing atmosphere for the message he was desperately trying to send. It only took a few miniutes desperately pounding buttons to open a radio channel with earth. Almost immediately the face of Duke's military commander appeared on the screen. \"Just what the hell is going on?\" he roared, yelling usually being the only way information could be made to bypass Duke's thick skull.<br /><br />Even years afterward, when fame and fortune were his, Duke always felt a stab of pride when ffootage from his world saving mission was broadcast in any medium. The scene was perfect, the flickering lights, cramped space and explosions, his hair slicked back with sweat and a headwound [Blasted doorframe was so damn low!] bleeding copiously as he struggled valiantly to save earth from destruction, utter perfection. Total fiction too, but it was looks that were important. He tried to look heroic [and managed 'constipated'] and boldly delivered his spoel \"Sir! It was an ambush! Thousands of droids! We fought bravely, but only I managed to survive! They've cloaked thousands of attack ships so they're completely invivble, I'm trying to *oof!* fight them off, but I don't know how long I can keep this up!\"  The commanders eyes widend as the message sank in. Duke continued, playing the situation like a grand piano. \"Sir! I managed to locate the command center! All we have to do is nuke the contol computer and we're safe! The crater my ship blasted off from, sir, you've got to hit it with everything you can sir I- aaaaggghh!\" Duke let the scream die as he turned off the monitor. The impression of his sudden defeat under fire would only be strengthened by the fact that while talking he'd managed somehow to fry the ships circuits, and it was plunging, smoking and sparking, into the north atlantic ocean.<br /><br />*Meanwhile again...*<br /><br />\"Um, hi.\" Keen shook hands with the anthropomorpic personification known as War. He'd already met Pestilence and Fammine, most of the muses and the fates. Silently Keen cursed Mot Hahal again. Stupid Vorticon! He was in a rather sombre looking house, all done up in black and white, skulls and bones, overlaid with lots and lots of frilly pink lace. Of all the things he had expected, this had totally thrown him. Death walked over, accompanied by a rather bouncy looking girl in a frilly pink dress. If she had lain against one of the decorated walls she would have been invisible. She would have looked completely normal too if it wasn't for the fact that her skin was pale white excepting her pitch black lips and hair... and eyes. \"Ah, you must be Misery.\" Keen remarked politely \"You look so much like your father.\" Misery for her part was overjoyed, reminding Keen of his hyperactive neighbour, Jess Rocket. It only took Misery two miniutes however to halt her monolouge of praise and admiration befroe dashing off to boast to her friends.<br /><br />Inwardly Keen cursed again. Here he was, the special guest of Deaths' daughter's birthday party and all because that bastard Vorticon had made six lousy computer games! All he'd done was help the guy fill out a green card, the next thing you know he starts up a software company 'retelling the adventures of Commander Keen so that all humans will know of his deeds' and running around calling himself Tom Hall! Geez, he could at least have picked a less derivitive name. Keen sighed, well, it could be worse, most dead people were just ushered into the next world, here he got cake first.<br /><br />Cake as black as a starless night, but chocolate cake all the same.<br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Feel the topic snake along, at 20 replies per page!<br /><br />Now edited to comply with the 2005 Najawation act.<br /><br />*<br />Chapter 45: The revelation<br />*<br /><br />The group stared at the roomm beyond. It was empty, totally empty, or nearly so. It was about the size of a large stadium, almsot barren save the odd bank of computer equipment, however, this was a prepared barreness, it had an air about it of being a whole lot of action just hidden away somewhere, rather than the neglected feeling of normal barreness. There were a number of large shapeless structures in the room, outlined in solid steel. Domminating the room, just off in one corner was a large column that Mort knew was the shielded reactor. Even as he stared he could feel the energy pulsing from it. What worried him was what the other structures were, despite its innocent appearance the room was probbably a lot more complicated than the previous reactor room.Then he noticed the man.<br /><br />He was standing roughly in the middle of the room, on a low platform, facing away from them. It is well known that the senses possessed by heroes are exactly akin to those possessed by villians, and currently Mort was experienceing the strange sensation that the man was looking right at him without having to turn around. For a moment the participants were frozen in space and time, silent except for the dulled pulsing of the reactor. Then the mysterious man spoke. \"Well, well, well. You have caused a lot of troubble for me young man, quite a lot indeed.\" It was a calm collected voice, stating a statement rather than voicing an opinion. \"My earth base destroyed, my techbot army defeated, and me forced to flee to the moon. You really have it in for me don't you Mr MacMayer? At this Mort paused [not that anyone noticed, he was standing still anyways.] He'd heard that name used before, had <i>he</i> used that name before?, it was beginning to sound familiar. \"I'm sorry,\" he said plainitively \"Do I now you? You seem familiar.\"<br /><br />Mort sensed the figures fury, he could almost see him shake with repressed anger. When he next spoke it was with a voice icy enough to keep milk fresh for a month. \"You...don't...remember...me? Do you perhaps remember the Berkely High Energy Fission Building?\"  Mort considered this. He did, thats when he'd used the name MacMayer, Mark MacMayer. He'd faked an Id and beard and joined as a midget nuclear technician. He'd learnt a lot about nuclear technology, but his experiment in fusion had... \"Ah, you seem to remember something. Very good Mr <i>McMire</i> I must admit it took me a while to track you down, but with you on my monitors for so long, I managed to find your house eventually.\" On a nearby computer screen an areial view of Morts house appeared. It had a target on it. Mort gasped in shock, he knew what it meant. \"No! You can't!\" he yelped in horror. The figure smiled an turned around. Laurael gasped.<br /><br />He was human, his age hard to tellbecause he had no hair, but he was at least thirty. He wore a grey T-shirt and blue pants they were both of unusual design, more like a uniform than casual clothing There was a metal plate bolted to his right shoulder. The most notable feature though was a large metal plate bolted to the left side of his face and head, like some bizzare metal cancer. He smiled a cold, evil smile. \"Can't I? I have the laser aimed and ready. I'm going to kill you Mr McMire, but first I'm going to make you suffer for what you did to me.\" Xky moved fast, almost inperceptibly so. The figure, anticipating some reaction simply threw a punch that occupied the place where Xky's head was going to be. Xky was hurled back twenty feet before coliding with a wall. Najawa looked in horror at his fallen comrade and was surprised to find himself already heading toward the arch villian. Furious at the attack on his fellow henchman, he decided on a spinning kick instead of a straight punch, twisting his body in midair to switch maneuvers. Strong and fast though he was, the figure hadn't counted on Najawa's only slightly slower attack. The spinning kick knocked his feet out from under him and Laurael quickly attatched herself to his arm. The figure roared in pain before flinging the vorticon across the room to join the prone Xky in a heap. \"Enough of this! To hell with it! I'll kill you all vermin!\" yelled the figure as the room began to change.<br /><br />Mort looked at the shifting walls in horror. \"Awww nuts!\" he mumbled quietly.<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Happy Naj?<br /><br /><br />*<br />Chapter 46: Attack and defense<br />*<br /><br /><i>'Suffering is really Keen!'</i> Keen finnished filling out the last autograph. It had been a long, interesting and tiring 'day' According to Death he'd be sent back as soon as his body regained consiousness, which would only be a few miniutes after his out of body experience began. He watched detachedly as his soul began to reconnect with his physical form. Deaths world grew nebulous and he began to float in that warm pink haze that fills your mind just after you've woken up but before you realize that last night you so drunk you told your boss exactly where he could shove his performance evaluation.<br /><br />He woke up blind and deaf, coughing dust. Struggling to stand Keen found that he was immersed at the bottom of a lake of dust almost twenty feet deep. Only by swimming slowly upwards was he able to reach the suface, and only by more swimming to extract himself from the dusty mass. Standing on the lakes 'shore', stille knee deep in dust and desperately trying to remove the fine powder from his eyes ears and clothing, Keen looked at his entry point in the middle of the lake. By his reckoning he had hit the lake at full speed and simply shot straight to the bottom, slowed to a stop by a giant dusty cushion. Currently Keen focused on locating the rest of the group. They couldn't be far away, he'd supposedly only been out for a few miniutes, but he couldn't get anything except static on his SEP transmitter. He was also now a uniform shade of grey, and shed a fine cloud of dust as he walked. Nevermind, he knew where he was, now all he had to do was find out where he should be...<br /><br />*Meanwhile*<br /><br />The walls slipped away, doors opened and the floor slid back. The group skittered and ran in random directions as the floor tilted beneath them. The reactor was unshielded, bathing the room in bright light and deafening sound. Spikes appeared out of the walls and floor, forcing the group to concentrate into the center of the room. Then there was the hissing.<br /><br />They appeared from the open doorways, thousands of them, moving rapidly across the jagged floor with ease. Flames, hubdreds and hundreds of flames. The sound they made was like a billion rashers of bacon frying on the biggest frypan in the world [and Texas] They were all about two feet tall, bright orange and had the suggestion of a face in them. Whatever they were, firing at them did noting, and something would be needed to be done soon, the group was surrounded and the flames were closing in. The evil figure laughed sinisterly. \"Of course Mr McMire, while your friends will perish in the flames of my Splatterbangs, I shall deal with you myself!\" As he spoke the platform he stood on rose on a tripod of legs. Underneath it was a very large and fully loaded machine gun pointed directly at Mort.<br /><br />Xky backed up until he was back to back with Najawa. Laurael and Main were simalary positioned in a corner between two jutting pieces of floor. Xky spoke calmly above the reactors pulsing. \"Najawa, you may be an idiot, you may have no common sense and be butt ugly to boot, and quite frankly there are moments when I fantasize about your painful death. However, I no longer hate you as much as I used to, and it looks like we're the only people here who are even remotely good at fighting. We'll have to stay alive, keep the rest of the group safe and somehow defeat this guy. I haven't the faintest idea how, but lets just pretend we're lifelong buddies who have dozens of plans for doing this.\" Najawa scowled \"I'm ugly? Says you Mr never shaves. You've got yourself a deal.\"<br /><br />And then everything happened at once.<br /><br />[Strictly speaking this isn't true, the smallest peroid of time the <i>everything</i> can happen in is a thousand billion years, so what really happened was a number of fast paced events all simultaneously occurred, but I was trying to be dramatic, well its ruined now isn' it?

Landing several feet away, right amongst the flames, stepping quickly to avoid the moving tounges of fire in what looked comically like an crazed attempt at tapdancing. Performing this odd dance Xky and Najawa managed to place Laurael and Main ontop of a bankof computers, safe for the moment as the flames seemed to be concentrating on the two dancers with worrying inteligence, anticipating thier moves and swarming around them. Xky knew that unless they found some way of damaging these things they were going to be in deep troubble. Already he could feel the hot burning of tired muscle and the dulling effect of metabolic poisons, two things the flames would not worry about. Next to him Najawa was faring worse, having to occasionally bat a flame from his trouser leg. The air was begginning to smell like charred fabric. Suddenly a metal claw smacked down next to him, just barely missing his leg. The flame that had occupied that area of groung splattered... and died. \"Interesting...\" mumbled Xky.<br /><br />The machine gun barrel whirred. Just in time Mort dodged the hail of bullets which chipped a zagged line into the floor. A steel leg swung up, taking a layer of paint off the top of Morts helmet as hu ducked the decapitating blow. Rolling along the ground he dodged the pointed tips of two more legs as they tried to puncture neat little holes in his chest. More bullets punctured into the wall behind him as he ran desperately, zigzagging in an attempt to buy time as he searched for somewhere, anywhere to hide. Another leg, this one slashing a deep gouge into the computer bank next to him. Sparks and smoke billowed from the stricken computers, for a moment obscuring Mort, a momentary advantage that Mort used to duck under and behind the platform. Quickly aiming and firing his plasma rifle he let loose with a burst of fire. Each bullet seemed to hit an invisible wall about an inch away from the machine, exploding in a bright flash of light. The contraption turned around, its controller staring right at him. \"Ha! Do you honestly think you can defeat the great Doctor Proton?\" he smirked.  More bullets, another swipe with a leg. Mort knew he couldn't keep this up forever.<br /><br />Xky kicked furiously at the flames, knocking them left and right, it was of little use, there were too many, and it needed a powerful kick to extinguish just on of the firey beings.  Najawa hadn't got the idea yet, he was still aimless ly shooting at something on the wall, struggling to keep the flames off his legs. Suddenly he grabbed a cable off the wall and pulled. Ten feet of arm thickness cable came off in his hands. For a moment Xky was puzzeled, until Najawa started to whirl the cable at high speed, low to the ground. At such speeds the cable cut the flames in half, clearing a wide circle around him as the firey sea collapsed. Xky started firing at the wall too, detaching a much larger length of cable, some twenty feet in length and as thick as his neck, something that would be hard to start moving, but very hard to stop. He spun with all his strength, ignoring the burning of the flames at his feet as slowly, slowly the cable began to move.<br /><br />The leg cut a neat nick in Morts arm, causing him to scream in pain. He was tired and running out of options. Then he noticed Xky, calmly walking forward[ish] while spinning a large length of cable, unsteadily cutting his way through the sea of flames. Najawa seemed to have had the same idea. Suddenly Mort was inspired. He dashed toward Xky hoping his opponent wouldn't have the insight to spot his plan. Predictably Dr Proton followed, shotting ever more accurately at Morts fleeing figure, fortunately avoiding the now very close Xky.<br /><br />Xky had removed twenty feet of copper cable. Copper has a density five times that of water. The volume of copper now whirling around Xky was just over a third of a  cubic meter, with a weight of just under a third of a ton, moving at a speed of one revolution per second. Thats a lot of inertia to hit three small legs designed more for support then strength. Jumping quickly over the cable as if it were a jumprope, Mort watched the cable cut cleanly through the platforms legs without stopping. For a second the entire contraption remained stable, seeming to suppost itself of the stubby stumps of its supports, but then it tilted and fell, only to be hit by the cable again. This time the two masses were more equal. The cable stopped cold, flinging Xky and the platform across opposite sides of the room, both cutting a swathe in the now much dimminished army of flames. Dr Proton struggled to escape from the platform as it sparked and smoked. He jumped up, a small pistol in both hands.<br /><br />And then, quite simply, the room exploded.<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-confused.gif[/img] <br /><br />*<br />Chapter 48: Boom!<br />*<br /><br />Keen pogoed, soaring meters into the air, long enough for him to take a good look around. He could see, just a few hundred meters away, the hole in the ice cavern created by his grenade before this whole fiasco began. He fell swiftly, bounding upwards again an instant later. Pitch blackness gave way to the odd brightness of space as he left the craters shadow. It was peaceful in the vacum, almost enjoyable pogoing from rock to rock, and to think, soon he'd be back in the hallways, fighting for his life again. Sometimes life could be so unfair!<br /><br />It was about then, twenty meters above the moons surface, [Come on Americia, succumb to metric!] where he could just peek over the lunar crater he was in that he noticed the approaching points of light. Points. Plural. There were maybe two dozzen of them, moving swiftly and with purpose toward some point on the lunar surface. With growing interest Keen realized they were going to land, if not directly on top of him, pretty close. They were moving across the sky faster now, homing in on something. Keen could see that now they were closer, they were actually cylinders, with the sun gleaming off their polished metal sides. On them were a number of designs. Now they were very close indeed, too close for comfort. Now Keen realized with a cold feeling in the pit of his stomach just what those designs were. They were flags, mostly Americian and Russian, but there were some othe countries too. All in all, not a good omen, Keen thought. As time seemed to slow down, as it always does near death, Keen tried to work out just how much Uranium and Plutonim were headed his way and their kenetic energies. As he watched the flag on the fully equipped Americian Patriot series nucler missile fill his field of vision, only one thought had time to pass through his brain. 'Huh, I see why Rorie doesn't like these guys very much...'<br /><br />\"OH? YOU AGAIN?\"<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />It was like an earthquake; the entire room seemed to jump up ten feet in the air, then fall twenty [Okay, so I'm using imperial, Bush said I had to.] There was an explosion of sound that immediately deafened everyone present. The reactor stopped turning, and started to spark. Huge chunks of ceiing began to fall. \"Just great,\" though Mort. 'This is what? The second time today? Or the third? Just what the hell is it with these places?' Dr Proton had been thrown across the room in the explosion, now in the flickering light of the overheating reactor he struggled to his feet. Somehow his base had been attacked! But how? Nevermind. He pushed his way through the wreckage toward his escape. Najawa tried to stop him,only to be smacked agaist the wall. His escape machine was ready and charged. He may have been arrogant, but he'd always made sure to plan ahead. It was a small blue... device, just large enough to stand in, a cylinder open at the top and one side. The top was covered with a complicated net of wires and foil.He turned and looked at his opponents, two of which were already running toward him, intent of finnishing him off. He laughed at their imminent doom. \"Fools! I will depart this place and return at full strengh... <i>before</i> I left! This machine will self destruct and you will perish in the ruins of my lunar base! \"What?\" shouted Mort and Xky, both nearly at the machine, and still deaf.<br /><br />The machine whirred, and exploded, sending lethal metal and plastic shrads in all directions. When Xky and Mort got up, the doctor had dissapeared. Mort looked around frantically, already their only exit had been blocked by a large chunk of ceiling, and the reactor was begginning to emit a shrieking noise. [At least his hearing was coming back, but thats Mort for you, never looks on the bright side.] As it turned out, they didn't have to worry about the reactors imminent explosion, as it was more likely the room would collapse on them first. Slowly, as if everything were immersed in maple syrup [Mmmm, pancakes] a section of ceiling at the far end of the room fell in. Followed by the rest of the room, ceiling falling, walls moving in, the entire room slowly falling in apon itself, a wall of... well wall heading toward the cowering figures like a mutant tidal wave. And then everything moved...sideways, and there was the felling of the entire world falling into its own navel.<br /><br />Mort stood up, this was very hard to do, as technically he wasn't standing on anything, but the SEP field managed it. He was... standing, maybe floating in some kind of void. Along with him were assorted pieces of wall, floor and ceiling, and the rest of the group. The void itself was a strange purplish blue, as if the colors on the skin of a bubble had been made into a paint and Mort was immersed in it. The others were in various states of surprise, confusion, and in Lauraels case, epileptic joy. Mort had heard of the saying 'tail wagging the dog' but in this strange void, and with nothing holding her down as it were, the laws of inertia meant that this was exactly what was happening. This made her attempts to thank Xky rather more difficult, as she was constantly rotating around her own rear end. Nevertheless, she managed to cover Xky with assorted slobber and praise. Najawa sidled over, his nose bleeding from where he'd been hit. \"Huh, looks like you've got a fan eh Xky?\" he chuckled. Laurael slowly turned to face him, her tail still doing its best to impersonate a helicopter blade, and performed a tackle-hug that would have brought tears to any fan of anime. Najawa quickly found himself embedded in 170 pounds of hyper Vorticon. \"Gaiieee! You saved my life too! Zibble! Eeeek! You've been injured! Lookit the blood! You'll never get that clean, let me help!\" Mort tried to ignore Najawa's protests as he tried to figure out just where the heck he was. After some miniutes of this he tried to obtain some measure of order.<br /><br />\"Hey! If everyones stopped thanking, jumping on, and licking everyone else here, I'd like to have some ideas about just whats going on?\" He had to duck as Laurael attempted another tackle-hug expressing her joy at not being shot by a lunatic in a robot suit. It was several miniutes before he could calm down her enough to be able to be heard over her profuse thanks. :Right, everyone okay? Good. Ideas. Us. Here. Now. Why?\" Najawa wiped some drool off his cheek. \"Stupid Vorticon.\" he mumbled. \"Well at least your nose isn't bleeding anymore, besides, its probbably the first bath you've had in weeks.\" countered Xky. \"Now, could this perhaps be due to the SEP field? Our death not being our problem?\" Mort considered this. \"No, not likely, the room was far to obvious a cause of death. This must be something else, but I still suggest we keep our SEP's on, just in case. I don't know if we can survive here, and besides, any disturbance could cause this void to do something unplesant.<br /><br />Just before the blinding flash of light, the entire group heard Najawa utter just one word. \"Ooops.\"<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Mod2.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Vote now!<br /><br />*<br />Chapter 49: Yes, me again!<br />*<br /><br />Keen stared into the grinning face of Death for the second time that day. [Of course Death was grinning, you think he could frown with a face like that?] He was back a Death's house, where the party streamers were just being packed away. War was asleep in the corner, having drunk himself into a stupor guzzling evaporated beer. \"I WAS SURE YOU'D LEFT. STAYED BEHIND TO HELP CLEAN UP EH? OH WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU'D BE WANTING TO GET BSCK THEN?\" Keen paused, a lightning plan forming in his mind. \"Actually, when you send me back, could you perhaps put me next to Mort and the rest of the group? Its just that it'd be a long way to walk otherwise, and I have a planet to save.\" Death considered this. \"OF COURSE. IT WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK OTHERWISE. I REMEMBER THE BLACK DEATH, WORKING ALMOST NONSTOP FOR 3 YEARS. VERY TIRING THAT.\"<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Mort awoke. Later. How much later he couldn't be sure, but he certainly didn't expect to awake staring at the face of a rather motherly looking middle aged lady. The woman looked in her late twenties, of some undefinable ethnicity, but her dark skin hinted at Africian descent, although there was something... odd about her face, something not quite right. Mort couldn't help but feel that he'd seen it somewhere else. The woman stepped back when she saw he was awake. \"Oh good. You're awake Mort. I'm afraid Mr Watterson is still out, but your friend Xky is awake. As soon as you feel strong enough come into the lounge, I made cookies.\" Mort stared as the woman left the room. Mort looked around. He was in a comfy looking small bedroom, decorated mostly is slick shades of black. Next to his bed were four others, only one occupied, by Najawa who was snoring loudly. The sheets were black and red, satin and cotton, and there were some brilliant posters of the entire galaxy posted on the walls. A telescope sat in one corner. Mort realized that he was staring at what could possibly be his dream room, if it had a few more additions. Lasers perhaps...<br /><br />He sat up and noticed for the first time that he was clean. Really clean. Bath clean. His clothing had also been neatly washed and ironed, even though he was still wearing it. Well most of it; the protective jacket and pants Keen had loaned him were sitting in a nice folded heap at the foot of the bed. Hanging from one of the bedposts was a nice black jacket, leather exterior, red silk lining, pockets for holding wepons and candy. Attached to the collar, in Morts own handwriting was a small card reading 'Though you might like this.' This was just getting more and more confusing. While he was out someone had stitched up the tears in his clothing given him a good supply of candy and provided a very stylish jacket for him. He checked it for booby traps, finding a dozzen more cards, all in his handwriting with coy little messages like 'Mind the lining, its expensive.' [And one saying 100% silk, Dry clean only.']<br /><br />With almost paranoid caution Mort proceeded down the hallway. Someone had removed the firing mechanisim from his gun and replaced it with another mystery note. The hallway was done in the same tasteful black and red combo the room was. Dark and menacing without being gothic, evil without being uncool. There were several doors leading off, all closed, all bearing notes to Mort advising him to keep them that way, and also simalar notes for Najawa... in his handwriting. The door at the end of the hall was open, and from it came the sounds of conversation. Mort approached with more caution, and almost had a heart attack when the strange woman appeared in the doorway, plate of cookies in hand. \"Oh hello, you're up? I was just about to bring you some cookies. They're doubble chocolate chip, your favourate.\" Mort was shocked that she knew his cookie preferences, more so when she handed him a glass of vortacola lite [Another favourate] and bustled him into a comfy black [what else] chair.<br /><br />Mort quickly glanced around the room he was in, it was much larger than he would have expected, almost a house in itself. An entire wall was taken up by a gian TV screen, chairs arranged around it. The opposite wall was dominated by a huge fireplce, currently occupied by a roaring fire, just in front of which lay Laurael, curled up asleep, occasionally making dreamy attempts to bite her tail. [This is actually the Vorticon equivalent of thumb sucking, usuallly abandonded by vortikids just after they lose the ability to stun. If Laurael had known how many people were viewing her infantile behaviour she probbably would have locked herself in her room for a week out of sheer embarassment.] In the middle of the room was a pool table... and an air hockey table... a table covered with candy, several large and expensive looking computers, more chairs, several vending machines giving out free candy, a trampoline and a death ray. Everything was done out in shades of black. If Mort stared hard enough he could almost see different colors. [Not say, real dark purple, which is normal, but a pitch black that was... well, purple colored black.] Finally, one entire wall was nothing but a giant window, looking out over a marvellous mountain range as the sun set slowly over a distant sea, clouds tinted red by the dying rays. All in all, an impressive sight. A <i>very</i> impressive sight. Indeed it would not be far wrong to sat that the only time Mort had seen anything like this was in his dreams. [And even then the fluffy pink unicorns had a bad habit of dropping by and ruining the effect.]<br /><br />Xky was lounging in another chair, quietly consuming a large bowl of borsch. He'd shaved. The strange woman continued to fuss and bustle about, seemingly oblivious of the fact that Morts world had just been turned upside down. He picked up a small black box lying on the table next to him. Inscribed on its side was the legend 'Edge of Map' and attached to it, in Xky's handwriting was a note 'Open me!' \"Hey Xky! Lookit this willya? Isn' this your handwriting?\" asked Mort chucking the box in Xkys direction. After some scrutiny Xky opened it, went pale in fear, screamed and hid behind the couch, where he sat shivering. \"Nothing.\" he moaned \"Sheer firmament, raw void! The edge of the universe!\" Mort looked at the dropped object, and verified that yes, it did indeed contain absolutely noting, including a total lack of space for there to be nothing in. \"Interesting.\" he mused as his famous infinite chronological loop equation ran through his head. \"Just what in all the tarpits of Gnosticus is going on here?\" he wondered.<br /><br />\"I'm glad you asked that.\" said a voice. Mort turned, and stood facing himself.<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Mod2.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

What about eggs???<br /><br />*<br />Chapter 50: Whee 50th chapter special!<br />*<br /><br />For an instant, before surprise and confusion overtook his fear, Mort shivered. The figure that had appeared, as if from nowhere instantly commanded everyones' full attention. He was the epitome of pure evil, like something taken right out of an anime. He was in his mid twenties, wearing a tasteful black and red suit. Not the corporate kind, but one designed to be comfortable, to be worn around the home as it were. It also had one heck of a lot of pocets. The figure himself seemed to exude an air of menace. He had piercing eyes, so brown they verged on reddish, his hair was medium length, swept back in a rakish style, an so black it looked like a hole cut into the vacum of space. He wore little else of note, a silver watch and an interesting talisman around his neck, it was shaped out of lead, a capital M. Despite all this, Mort knew as soon as he set eyes on him, that he was somehow, staring at himself. Mort composed himself, this was no time for doubt. \"Just what's going on here?\" he demanded.<br /><br />The figure smiled, then took a seat between Mort and Xky. [Who had got up from behind the chair and was now trying to hide the jitters his recent shock had given him.] \"I think we should wait until Mr Watterson awakes and your frind Mr Blaze getshere. Oh, that reminds me, Naj?\" Another figure entered the room, simalarly attired in a neat black suit with a large red M printed on the pocket. He was older than the first figure, with a neat goatee trimmed in the devil style, stylish dark glasses over his eyes and a number of cold metal devies hanging from his belt, many of which were designed to do unpleasant things to sensitive parts of the anatomy. All in all it would have been quite an intimidating image if it weren't for the fact that he was wearing two red sneakers with laces untied, and a pink undershirt with the legend 'Tough!' embossed on it. \"Naj, Najawa... right?\" mumbled Mort numbly. He was begginning to get some idea of what was happening.<br /><br />At that moment Najawa entered the room shaken and confused as Mort had been. He had recieved the same general sprucing up treatment [and a bit of oaking up too.] as the others He opened his mouth, as if to ask a question, looked around the room, paused, then headed wordlessly for the candy vending machines where he stayed for quite some time. The second figure watched Najawa with disdain, as if he were a puppy that hadn't got the hint about housetraining. \"Huh, boy was I an idiot.\" he said with a laugh. \"Oh well, live an learn.\" Mort was much calmer now, everything was fitting into place. \"Yeah, but just how much living have you done Najawa? I'm going for maybe 20 years? You certainly age well.\" The first figure grinned at this. \"19 years actually, but a good guess. I was always a sharp one wasn't I? Well, I'll explain everything as soon as Keen gets here.\" There was a long pause. \"And whe will that be?\" asked Mort. \"Oh... about... ... now.\" replied the figure. There was a dull thunderclap, the kind of sound an 8-year old boy's worth of air would make if it were suddenly displaced. <br /><br />And there stood Keen. Dusty, tired and twice dead. He looked around. \"Any chance of a soda?\" he asked, but the drinks tray was already heading his way.<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Mod2.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

		"content": "*<br />Chapter 51: c'mon Xky, what about those eggs???<br />*<br /><br />The group seated themselves on various chairs and couches [After Najawa had been pried away from the candy machine and Laurael woken up, much to her embarassment from a dram involving the chasing, catching and mutilation of thousands of pink Hello Kittens, a cute adorable cartoon character loathed by thousands of Vorticon parents forced to buy them for their impressionable pups.] Of the assembled group, only Mort was sure that he was dealing with some form of time travel, the others were in various states of confusion, bemusement, and,in the case of Laurael, a desire to consume large amounts of candyfloss. [The fact that Najawa was both confused and bemused was nothing unusual, this was his normal state of existance.] The elder version of Mort seated himself in a chair facing the group, waited until he had their full attention, and spoke. \"I'm sure all of you excepting my younger self and his friend are wondering just whats going on here. Very well, pipe down for a bit, this'll take some explaining. Firstly, this is the year 2025, wintertime. You are currently in my winter palace, which, as ruler of the entire world, I have several of. All of your future selves are alive and doing well, although youmay not like what they're doing, or who you've become. I'm sure you all noticed Mr Watterson-Kinoshi, my left hand man and bodyguard here.\" he pointed at the older Najawa. Keen had jumped up at the mention of 'ruler of the entire world' and now struggled to voice his shock. \"Ruler... of the world? You? How?\" he spluttered. The older Mort smiled. \"Through a complex and devious plan that I'm not going to tell you, for obvious reasons. However, you can rest assured that the current condition of Earth meets your future selfs standards, if not his acceptance. We will have time to look around later, but please, let me continue.\" Keen sat down, a thousand thoughts pulsing through his head, barely able to keep listening to the conversation. His trigger finger began to itch. [Given that he now had a full body case of vortipox, and under his coating of moondust was a pleasant blue color, he itched all over anyway, but this was a special kind of itch.]<br /><br />\"Now then, I brought you here with my time machine, which we can examine shortly. I did this because I remembered being taken here when younger, and this not getting killed on the moon. Remembering stuff that happening to you happens a lot, so if you meet yourself, do be aware of this. Now, I suggest we make our way to my labratory, where I will do a lot more explaining and we can get around to why we're here.\"  With that he got up and headed toward a doorway in the far wall that hadn't been there a miniute before. The middle aged woman Mort had met earlier rushed up to Keens now quite dusty chair and gave out a frustrated sigh. \"Dear look, I'll never get all this dust out, its so fine!\" Mort turned and made a vauge gesture, a small spidery robot appeared through a sort of square mousehole that appeared in the wall. It ambled across to the chair and started cleaning. The dust was too fine however, and probably wouldn't shift. \"Don't worry Lindsey,\" piped Older Mort, \"I'm sure I can build something to deal with it.\" He walked trough the door with the rest of the group following, except for Keen and Mort. Keen was devestated, he'd always had a kind of crush on Lindsey, and even though he knew it would never amount to anything, he was still shocked at what he'd just heard. Mort however had a rather strange grin on his face. His voice hoarse with awe Keen barely managed to ask Lindsey \"You married Mort? But, but, you always seemed so... <i>nice!\"</i> Lindsey grinned, then performed an acrobatic twirl, her long red dress spinning around her like some demented ameoba. \"Ugh, tell me about it. All that innocence and helpfulness gets so dull! Besides, I am a princess, well, a queen now. Anyone with money and power is bound to be attractive. Oh, and there was that wedding at St Pauls cathedral.\" She made for the door, then walked back and picked up a diamond the size of a pidgeon from a small jewlery box over the fireplace. Attached to its bottom was a small gold ring. \"Oh yes, Mort will want this, its vital to his time machine working.\"<br /><br />Numbly Keen followed Lindsey down the passage. He turned briefly to Mort. \"And you can wipe that grin off your face!\"<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Mod2.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Mort said: \"I did this because I remembered being taken here when younger, and this not getting killed on the moon. Remembering stuff that happening to you happens a lot, so if you meet yourself, do be aware of this.\"<br />Paradoxically because he met his older self there when he was younger (at this very moment), he did stuff to end up in that (exact) point of time. But since he said about stuff happening if you remember it, it may be that not everything happens, and it isn't deterministic. This is interesting chapter.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-shikadi.gif[/img]  <br /><br />*<br />Chapter 52: A little labwork<br />*<br /><br />A short walk later Keen emerged into Older Morts' lab, still upset about Lindsey, and exceedingly embarassed about feeling upset. OM's lab made Morts pale in comparision; it was either very big, or open to the sky; the walls stretched up until the feeble light at floor level no longer illuminated them. The colourscheme here was blue; the walls were a deep noonday sky color, most of the benches and equipment picked out in various shades. Although the lab was gigantic beyond belief, OM lead the way with a definite air of purpose, idly walking past structures that dwarfed Keens house, machines so complex Keen couldn't even begin to comprehend them. Out of the corner of his eye Keen spotted Mort pocketing a few small devices, and would have been annoyed if he hadn't already 'borrowed' a few interesting things himself. For a moment he wondered if Mort would only invent those things because he stole them from himself, who only invented them because... then his head hurt, he was thinking toomuch like Xky. To hell with it.<br /><br />After a while OM came to a stop in front of a rather mundane looking device, notable only in that it was surrounded by a large amount of empty floor. It was rather disapointing, barely taller than an man, it looked somewhat like  an undeveloped mushroom; a thick squat blue stem capped with what looked for all the world like a turtle shell. Large wires and tubes ran out of it inot various sockest in a nerby bench. OM tunred to the waiting group \"And this is the time machine that brought you here. Kind of; the machine is specific, whereas what I did was kinda rip you out of your time to here by manip-\" He was cut off by a crash, a 'wheee' and the appearance of a small girl riding a...a... something. It had an birds head, a striped reptilian neck and two legged body with a short tail, making it look vaguely like a wingless featherless ostrich. OM stepped in front of the creature, bringing it to a halt, before adressing the rider. \"Andy, what have I told you about running in my lab?\" The girl blushed and examined the floor. \"Um, not to do it because I might get mutilated, but-\" \"But nothing!\" replied OM sternly. \"I don't ever want to catch you doing this again alright Andrea?\" \"Yes Uncle Mort.\" replied the girl pretending to be very interested in one of her fingernails, then slowly urging the weird creature off roward God knew where.<br /><br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Xky sat down at his computer, logged on to the internet and went straight to his favourate site. After a few hours of looking at scantily clad russian chicks he decided to take a peep at his second favourate site, the PCKF. There was a new installment of Harvey's fanfic. Just great how many drools would- suddenly he was standing in a dark room, with several other people, a pink rabbit and a some sort of blue dog . There was an odd looking man talking to a young girl  who was riding some sort of \"Zibble?\" he mumbled. <br /><br />And then it was gone, he was back at his desk, in front of the computer, looking at the dozens of drool smilies Harvey had littered his latest post with. He tried to remember what had just happened, but it seemed to fade from his mind even as he thought. Was he dreaming? Yeah, that was it. There was something about a blue dog who would've looked cute if she were a naked russian chick. Speaking of which...<br /><br />*And now back to our regular broadcast...*<br /><br />\"Correct Mr Rauh.\" replied OM \"Now-\" Keen cut in. \"Daughter of yours Mort? I have to say, doesn't look like you.\" OM smiled evily. Not mine Mr Blaze, yours. Keen stared open mouthed for a while before stammering \"So... I'm married?\" OM smiled even wider. \"Oh yes, to that lovely girl on your street, what was her name? Ah yes, Jessica Maunders.\" Keen was stunned. \"What, Anime Jess? The cartoon freak?\"  \"Oh yes. I do believe her new series <i>The Cibbi Hour</i> grossed over 2.25 billion last year alone in merchandising alone. A pity neither parent could be here, pressing engagements. I like to help out though, and Lindsey just loves the little tyke. Now, back to time travel, unless you have some more gossip to discuss?\" Again the groups attention was drawn to the machine, various thoughts and questions buzzing through each one's heads. Mort was the first to break the silence. \"Okay me, I know the what and when, I wanna know the how, who, where and why.\" OM was equally blunt. \"Time machine, M theory. Dr Proton. The Alpacalupa Mountains. To save this world and yours from destruction.\" Keen was next, there was something he'd been dying to ask since he'd arrived.<br /><br />\"Do you have a cure for Vortipox? Because this rash is killing me!\"<br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Mod2.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Firstly, why bring us here? Why not interfere earlier along, before we were in any danger? Why not kill me at birth? And why are we still here? With a time machine you could do anything! Rule the world! Heck maybe thats how you did it!\" he finnished yelling, all the confusion and fear that had been building inside unleashed in that blurt. There was more he wanted to ask, where his elder self was, how his friends were doing, what did OM have planned. OM paused, looked at his watch and replied. \"Okay, could you just step back about three steps? Good. Now, I think I can answer all of your questions pretty much at once. A time machine has its limits; I can't do anything that would stop me inventing it and doing what I did. If I killed you at birth Mr Blaze, then I would have no need to go back and Kill you, so I wouldn't, and so on. <i>Thats</i> why I didn't interfere earlier, <i>thats</i> why I didn't and can't use it to rule the world and <i>thats</i> why there are no hordes of time travel tourists queing up at your house. Besides, I didn't invent this, I borrowed it off a friend in exchange for taking over a planet for him. Its how I got Lindsey's wedding ring too, its the power source for the focusing mechanisim..\"<br /><br />As OM ended his spiel Keen could hear a vaugely familiar pattering noise, something he hadn't heard since... since... since he'd last visited V- There was the familiar feeling of being simultaneously trod on and stunned as the vortikid ran off into the distance. His two pursuers however were stopped by Morts outstretched arm, conveniently placed to knock both young children to the ground. \"I'm getting sick of this,\" grumbled OM \"Why is it that as soon as I have important business to discuss everyone seem to- Lorinda! Stop trying to blast Andrew with that frapp ray! I will not have this fooling around in my lab!\" The one called Lorinda pouted as OM snatched a small raygun from her hand/ \"Buut daaad!\" she whined \"No buts! Didn't me and Mr Blaze declare earth a ceasefire zone? And I don't care if it doesn't apply to you, while you're under <i>my</i> roof you'll obey <i>my</i> rules!\" The other child, and older male version of Andrea put his hands in his pockets, concealing a neural stunner looked at the floor in the manner of one caught stealing from the cookie jar and mumbled \"My dad lets us fight over at his place.\" OM adopted an expression that suggested certain people would be spoken to later \"That is because your father is an irresponsible lout who doesn't even understand the benefits I can bring to the universe, let alone how to properly raise a child. Honestly, I don't know how you managed an IQ of 3 let alone 312. I've a right mind to ground the both of you, in cement this time. No go play outside and I don't want to hear another word out of either of you.\" Both children moped off in the manner of those who had just found a greater enemy then each other. Lindsey looked after them. \"Daer, are you sure you weren't too hard on-\" OM sighed in exasperation. \"What is this? An attempt to save the world or a daycare center? For chrissake lets get on with it before a kindy class pops out of my matter converter!\"<br /><br />He gathered his composure. \"Right, we're behind schedule. Dr Proton has a timemachine too, and he's not likely to be as consientious as me in using it. I've tried to interfere, but he keeps countering me, there's nothing I can do except attack him manually, and you're going to help me, this will be dangerous.\" Keen scowled \"And if we tag along you can be sure we'll survive because you're still here?\" OM shook his head. \"No, I just need all the help I can get, the way everything works, you could still die but I'd be here. Mr Blaze is already distracting Protons attack fleet, and he can't buy us more than a few hours. Now we're going to the armoury, then going to attack Proton, and if anyone has a problem with that I'll get my associate to hit you with his thwacky stick!\" The older Najawa's thwacky stick was six foot long and made of teak. There was rapid agreement by all present to go along with the plan.<br /><br />The group slowly filed out of the lab, Xky and Laurael being the last to leave. Laurael whispered excitedly.<br /><br />\"Wasn't he cute?\"<br /><br />\"No!\"<br /><br />\"Aww c'mon, he had your eyes!\"<br /><br />\"No he didn't, I'm not talking about it!\"<br /><br />\"Aww cmon,\"<br /><br />\"No!\"<br /><br />Now the lab was empty, save to figures hunced almost invisibly in the warm darkness behind an air conditioning unit. Their position was perfectly chosen, a full view of the time machine with minimum chance of being spotted. In it the older version of Xky stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"Maybe I shouldn't've started shaving\" he membled thoughfully, staring enviously at his younger selfs' prolific facial foliage. Next to him Laurael snickered \"Hehe, did you see they look on your face? Hey... do you think my tails going limp? Hers looked so perky.\"<br /><br />\"Not this again, I keep telling you, there's nothing wrong with your tail!\"<br /><br />\"Thats just what you'd say, for your information I've measured it, its drooped 1.3 degrees in the last month!\"<br /><br />\"Have you tried starching it? Or botox? C'mon, lets go raid Morts pantry, I'm hungry and those traps that second rate Nakawa set are piss-easy to flip.\"<br /><br />And then the lab was empty, the time machine flickering with its own internal light, almost smug amid the whirring machinery around it.<br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

I welcome your suggestions on what I look like, do, say, etc.<br /><br /><br />*<br />Chapter 55: So we're all set then?<br />*<br /><br />OM's armoury was fit for... well an army to be honest. Aside from the racks and racks of guns, there were also several tanks, various planes and atttack craft, and other, more indistinct weponry. OM walked straight up to a table loaded with sleek black guns. \"Right, to hell with understatement; these lil babe's are MGH 3000's; they're based roughly on the neural stunner in that they can be tuned up from a disorienting zap to a wall busting boom. Trigger. Adjuster. Any questions? No? Good. Now, I hope these'll work; every time I try something Proton uses his time machine to outwit me, adjusting his shield and whatnot.\" he walked over to several craft, hidden in shadow. \"Now these, they're a special nearly invisible stealth craft I call Shockers, after that weirdo hacker who hacked porn into the pentagon. They're the best tech I have, but I suspect we'll be shot down, so pack a parachute. Yes, Mrs... Mrs.. you know, I never did catch your last name.\"<br /><br />Laurael was gesturing wildly trying to catch OM's attention. Having it she seemed for a second to have forgotten what she wanted to say. \"Uh, innocent injured Vorticons don't have to do this right? I mean, I'm no Vortninja, heck I can't even jup the cracks in the pavement. So um, I'm sitting this out right?\" OM thought for a second. \"I guess so, its hard to remember anything about the attack, there's more than one time machine involved, and my past may not be your future. You're right, you probbably wouldn't be any use. Okay then, everyone, suits are over there, pick up any other stuff you think looks cool and we'll leave in five miniutes. Najawa will explain anything you need to know, an unusual task given that he barely knows what he's doing now, but I'm sure he'll be up to it.\" And with that he walked out of one of the rooms many doors.<br /><br />Najawa rumaged around one of the smaller tables at the back. He grabbed a gunbelt and holstered five stunners, a pistol and sawn off shotgun into it. He followed this with two ammo belts, a sackful of grenades. He hid two very sharp daggers up his sleve, and  several more in his pants legs, [tied securely enough to prevent slippage and removal of bits of course.] A garotting wire was wrapped around a wrist and hidden under a watch, some plastic explosive placed in his sneakers, a detonator under his tounge and an anti tank mine strapped to his back along with the backpack full of soinc flares. [As worn by the hedgehog in 1970!] He donned two pairs of brass knuckles, some night vision goggles and a protective kevlar vest. Grinning he confidently strode forward, and toppled over. His older version groaned with embarassment and ran over to pick him up. \"Oh for Pete's sake; just try not to get killed, and learn some real fighting n00B.\"<br /><br />In the corner Xky hefted a small antitank gun; the newer version was smaller and just didn't seem to have the good solid 'oomph' of the ones he used during the rebel attacks in Islamabad. He'd also managed to find a grey suit and dirty it thouroghly. Sure, black looked cool, but if you really wanted to be invisible, blend into the shadows, you needed a good dirty grey suit. He was snapped out of fond memories of strangling enemy troops in pitch darkness by the pleading tug of a paw on his sleeve. Laurael looked at him with pleading eyes. \"You're not honestly going to go through with this are you?\" she asked. \"Well, duh, Morts right hand man and all, besides, I'm the only one that seems to know how to do anything right here, except maybe older Najawa, and quite frankly I'm not sure just how good he is. I wish I was around to ask.\" Laurael frowned \"But you're not here; doesn't that make you wonder? Everyone's here but you and me, and I'm pretty sure I'm on Vorticon somewhere! You could get killed! Doesn't that worry you?\" Xky stared at her, the cold in his reply almost made har gasp. \"I've done this before, killed hundreds of times, I've almost lost count. You have no idea, this is just another day for me.\" Laurael couldn't keep the pleading out of her voice now. \"But.. but you can't! I love you!\" Xky frowned. \"Are you kidding? You've known me what? One day? We were jacked up on oxygen, get a clue! This has gone far enough.\" Laureal looked at him, taken aback. \"But, but...\" \"But nothing, I've gone along with this, and thought it over, and for chrissake! You're some kind of intelligent furry from another planet! I may not exactly lead a normal life, but even I have my limits. Get a clue, your older self obviously did.\"<br /><br />Keen watched Laurael run off crying. \"What happened to her?\" he asked quizzically. \"Stubbed her toe.\" mumbled Xky. darkly. Just then OM strode in, suited up in yet another, somewhat more armoured, black suit. \"Okay everyone, I hope you're ready, because I'm all set.

All that could be heard was the dull static of the radio links, keeping everyone in constant communication in case something went wrong. They were headed this time for the tropics, just off the west coast of Brazil. There was a tension in the air, a feeling not unlike that felt by the typical student just before an exam, and in a way this was a test, though admittedly you never got to resit the course. Suddenly there was a crackle over the radio. <i>\"Mr McMire? You have an appointment.\"</i> OM cursed. \"No I don't, I rule this planet, reschedule and screw them!\" The radio responded <i>\"I'm afraid he's rather insistent sir, and he is of the Globox empire.\"</i> OM sighed. \"Oh God, anything but him again.\" There was a pause then, <i>\"Uuuh, sir, it appears we've lost radio contact with him... there seems to be something interfering...\"</i> Suddenly a nearby cloudbank opened with a boom and a voice like thunder spoke. <b>\"Okay Mr McMire, just this once, and only because its you. Now we're even, stay away from my family!\"</b><br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />The Globox despot stared upwards at a sky that seemed connected to the heart of the sun itself. A wonderful and terrible voice burst forth.<b> \"Lord of Globox, I am your God!\"</b> The despot sniffed. \"Like heck you are! Blasted Earth food, always gives me halucinations!\" There was a surprised pause, then a terrible noise. And then silence. If you listened very carefully you could almost hear a faint conversaion coming from the charred pile of ashes that was once the Earthly form of the Globox Despot.<br /><br /><i>\"Hah! Call that proof! Could just be a meteor strike! Hey, what are you doing? Put me down! I'm not going someplace that doesn't exist! Hey!\"</i><br /><br />*Yet another meanwhile...\"<br /><br />\"Stupid Xky, thinks he's so cool... don't need him anyway...\" Laurael grumbled as she stalked down the castles corridor. All she could do now was wait to be sent back to her own time, and <b>then</b> she'd have to wait until a vorticon ship entered the area, that could take years! Of course, maybe Keen would give her a ride...? She never managed to consider this possibility however as whilst walking she unthinkingly walked straight into someone heading in the exact opposite direction at roughly the same speed. There was a clatter as pens, paper and books scattered everywhere and both participants found themselves sprawled on the floor. Laurael was first to pick herself up. She helped the young human to their feet. She was Lauraels age at a guess, but it was hard to tell on a species without hackles, with the typical mop of fur only on the upper head, cut rather short and a fetching shade of light brown. She was wearing a neat blue shirt and jeans and seemed surprised but bemused at the encounter. \"Sorry about that,\" she asid. \"I just don't look where I'm going when drawing. You're a... Volticon? I'm sure thats right. Should've expected a few offworlders in the emporeres place. Are you here to see him too? Only I've not the faintest idea where I am, and I'm scheduled to meet him in an hour to discuss trade with- oh I'm sorry, you probbably don't speak English. I'll just shut up then.\"<br /><br />Laurael decided that a bit of mischeif would brighten her day no end. \"Zo,\" she said, trying to recall that funny accent on her favourate show. \"Joo vant my to find a purple candle? How rood! The emporer vill haer of dis!\" The human blanched and dropped all her stuff again. \"Oh no! You can't! I can't affored to screw this up! This is my first government job! I'll be demoted! I don't want to go back to accounting!\" The human sounded even more pitiful than Laurael felt. \"Sorry, sorry, I'm kidding. I speak perfect English. We don't <i>all</i> bark you know. I'm not going to see anyone, and the emporers out, possibly forever, so I think your meeting's cancelled. Oh, forgive me; Laurael.\" she held out a paw, remembering just in time to retract her claws and wag her tail, humans seemed to find that more friendly. The human held out her hand. \"Andrew; Andrew Aaron Abel Stolzky, ym mother had a thing for 'a'.\" Laureal took a step back and examined the human more closely. \"Uuh, you're male? Sorry, its just so hard to tell with a species not covered in fur.\" The human laughed \"Especially in my case; I don't know what it is, people mistake me for a girl all the time, apparently I look 'androgynus' or something. People call me Gal for short, you can guess why. Oh well, can you help me with my stuff, guess I won't need it now.\" In amongst the many charts and binders there was a notebook full of odd looking drawings, including several that resembled vorticons. \"Hey, whats this; do you study anatomy too?\" she asked. Gak shook his head, \"Nah, I'm a furry artist.\" Laurael paused \"You... draw cartoons? I must admit, that looks just like Minnie Meep.\"<br /><br />\"No, no, you know, furries... well actually, I guess you don't. There are people who are interested in drawing fuzzy catoon character and stuff. I'm not into the whole dressing up convention kinda stuff.\" Laurael tried to analyse the unfamiliar sentence. \"Dressing up? Like other species? I was a Foob once for All Spirits Eve, is it like that?

Meh, maybe we'll see why.<br /><br />*<br />Chapter 58: Three this time!<br />*<br /><br />Keen stared out of the shaded canopy at the sky outside, clouds whipping past like the insubstatial steam they were. It was almost relaxing, just sitting back and allowing the autopilot to carry him across the invisible borders of countries below. Brazil looked so beautiful from the air, especially since it had been reforested, the fact that a thousand mile high green 'M' was growing in hundred foot trees on it did little to spoil it. OM crackled over the radio. \"Better switch to manual guys, Protons spotted us.\" Keen made the switch, grabbing the control stick in the familiar grip of a computer game player who had to fly his own ship. He looked around cautiously, trying to find the location of the attacking fleet. His instruments showed nothing. \"Uh, I'm not getting anything on rada-\" OM snorted \"Yeah, Proton knowws we're coming doesn't he? Do you think he wouldn't take precautions? We're going to have to do this by visual contact, split up into pairs and guard each others' flanks!\"<br /><br />Keen veered left, pairing with OM in the hope that he was a better shot than he was. [Think about it, that sentence makes sense.] Keen had never fought in a ship of any kind before, most of his battles being close up, and non lethal. Suddenly he spotted a craft bursting out of a cloudbank and his hopes fell. It was transparent, or nearly so, barely visible as the rippling of clouds in its wake. It moved so fast he could barely keep track of it. Then it moved into open sky.<br /><br />\"Aww nuts\" said Keen for the fifth time that day.<br /><br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Lindsey McMire watched the robot continuing its attempt to removve the lunar dust Keen had left on it. She wondered vaugely what other wives without 2'240 assorted robotic assistants would do in this situation before returning her concentration to the trade problems between the badlands and the northern provinces. Sometimes being a queen could be so tiring, the sooner Lorinda could take up the role of princess the better. The phone rang. Sighing Lindsey drafted a six point unilateral goods and services agreement and posted copies to both parties before answering the call. As usual it was pointless socializing. Some queens had nothing better to do all day! \"No Eva I'm not free saturday. Why? Saturday I'm negotiating the mining contract with Zelta IV. <i>Whats mining</i>? Are you crazy? Thats why your planet was enslaved right there, total incompetence. Of course I'm condescending, I'm <i>queen</i>! If you don't like it stop calling, I'm sure Miss peach is free. What do you mean <i>only</i> a princess? Oh to hell with it, pi$$ off!\" Lindsey terminated the call in a huff. It seemed that all royalty did these days was waste money and get in the papers. Heads full of cotton wool the lot. She felt better though, there was something about a good swear that did that. And the trade agreement had been accepted! Lindsey closed the comm link filled with the warm fuzzy feeling that came with a job well done [Or sitting on a kitten.] <br /><br />She looked up as two figures entered the room. One was the vorticon lass she'd seen earlier, the other was... ah yes, the trade minister from Stanistan. \"I'm sorry Mr Stolzky, your meeting has been postponed, if you'll call back to- what is she doing?\" Laurael had removed most of her clothing and had glued a zipper on her chest. She had also borrowed a sheet of paper and a pencil and was scribbling furiously. She gave Lindsey a cheerful smile \"I'm a furry! I've finally got the perfect disguise! I can study humans unseen and pass my exobiology course with record marks! Yay!\" Lindsey managed a sneak peek at the piece of paper Laurael was waving, it had a neat sketch of her on it, complete with rather embarassing estimations of her weight, age and social status. The young man next to her seemed to be quite shaken and appeared to be trying to dissuade the vorticon from her course of action. \"I don't think you quite understand, its not that subtle, besides, shouldn't you carry out an areial observation first?\" <br /><br />\"Thats what I was doing when I got shot down here! I'll have some choice things to say about violent behaviour! I can't wait to add to my notes on human social interactions and mating behaviour!\"<br /><br />\"Well you've got to realize that you probabbly won't experience 'normal social' wait, WHAT??\"<br /><br /><br />*Yet another meanwhile...\"<br /><br />Levellord crept along the balcony toward the open window. Here would be as good  a place as any to begin the attack. Nobody would be prepared, and there were children, tasty young children.

He spotted a blur and fired, trying to keep it in his sights. He was rewarded with a bright explosion and the sight of the deshielded ship plummeting toward earth. There were shouts over the radio as Xky and both Najawas tried to relay the position of enemy ships to each other, with mixed results. Both Morts said nothing, not even an expleteive. There was another round of fire and suddenly Keens ship jerked violently; now it was moving in big slow arcs rather than a straight line. There was smoke pouring out from someplace, and smoke entering the cockpit too. Something had gone really wrong, but fortunately Keen had his parachute. \"Hey Morty, how tough is the glass in this plane?\" he asked over the comm-link. \"Pretty tough, they can handle a direct hit by an antitank gun; hey wait, you've been hit! For chrissake bail out!\" Keen had every intention of doing so, but first... Several craft exploded as Keens ship cut through them, he didn't have to be accurate, sheer size was enough to assure a hit. Deep down Keen was annoyed that he'd only managed to shoot down<br />only one craft. As his ship veered uncontrollably he simply tried to maneuver it into as much air as possible, scoring several more hits, and gasps from the radio as he almost colided with those he was protecting.<br /><br />There was a series of explosions behind him and Keen decided that now was a good time to leave, the thought that he'd just ruined an expensive ship that had been specially prepared for him flitting through his mind, along with the thought that it had been specially designed to fail. As the ground whirled crazily beneath him he popped open the canopy and jumped. Apart from being hit by the ship as it spun Keen executeda perfect escape. He watched it plummet beneath him, explode in midair like a brilliant firework and continue its descent in pieces. Sadly, having almost been hit as it fell below him, he now had to dodge as he fell through the explosion, coughing as smoke blinded and choked him. Small piecees of hot metal bumbped into him lightly as he left the cloud behind, singeing his hair and clothing. \"Just great\" Keen thought \"And I just had this washed too!\" However, once free from the possibility of injury, the ride down was quite pleasant; there was a feeling of weightlessness and speed, tempered by the fact that the ground was slowly getting closer... In a few miniutes he'd have to open the chute, land, and somehow infiltrate Protons base, but for now everything was nice and peaceful, like that half awake moment you spend each morning in bed.<br /><br />Then the craft opened fire.<br /><br />*Meanwhile*<br /><br />Gal shuffeled his papers somewhat nervously; the Queen and he had had a nice long talk about trade deficit and accounting systems, which had calmed him a lot and taken his mind off the crazy Vorticon who was bounding around the place. Lindsey had eventually shut her up by allowing her acess to a small [only a few acres] wardrobe, telling her to find something nice. At least everything wasn't lost; the required meeting wouldn't take place, but he could still send back a positive report and avoid demotion. He was strolling down the 23rd side passage in the west wing, heading for his ship when a blue blur pounced at him \"Au Naturel!\" barked the Vorticon excitedly. \"Gaaah!\" shrieked Gal in shock, dropping his books and papers for the second time that day. \"What in hells name? You can't do that, what?\" The Vorticon regarded him with an analytical stare. \"Soooo, would you say you were shocked, surprised, or both?\" she asked pulling a pad and pencil from nowhere [In thoery it had to be somewhere first for her to grab it, but it was probabbly best not to speculate on the possibilities.] Gal tried to talk to the Vorticon without looking at it. \"I'd say put some clothing on! For chrissakes there are children here!\" Laurael looked even more interested, and was scribbling furiously. \"Interesting... yet my researches into 'furries' indicate such sights are a common component of the lifestyle. You said you were a furry artist and yet this disgusts you?\" Gal blanched \"Not that kind of artist! Have you  gone mad?\" Laurael gave him a cold fixed smile, it looked as if it had been painted on with ice. \"Possibly! Its been a very stressful day and I may have snapped! Whee Zibble!\" And with that she cartwheeled out of the room. The actual cartwheel looked pretty impressive and Gal didn't manage to avert his eyes in time. \"Great, just great.\" he mumbled \"I'm gonna need therapy for this, I just know it.\"<br /><br />There was a voice by his ear, about the same time as a sharp cold metal blade was pressed to his throat. \"Oh I dunno, you might not live that long.\" it said.<br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/lind.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

It hit a cloudbank and Keen just had time to see it turn before once again it became invisible against the blue sky. Keen fumbled a bit and pulled out the plasma cannon OM had supplied. His great downward velocity already counted against it, but now he had two things stopping him from being a sitting duck. Keen tried to estimate the crafts position, aimed up and waited for it to fire. At the first sign of attack Keen pulled the trigger; a bright blast of pure energy scythed through the air cutting the craft in two, the seperate halves spiraling downward before exploding in twin fireballs. About midway through his victory sumersault Keen realized he'd have to open his parachute, or beome intimately aquainted with the ground.<br /><br /><br />*Meanwhile*<br /><br />Gal swalloed as he felt the pressure of the cold blade against his throat. \"Ummm, can I keep holding my stuff? I don't want to have to pick it up again. My wallets in my left trouser pocket, it has only $40 in it.\" The figure sniggered. \"You really should carry more cash. Besides, its not the money, its the killing.\" Just then the door burst inward and a blue blur whizzed by; it was wearing a fedora. Laurael stopped her mad dash about an inch from Gals nose, actually  frothing at the mouth slightly. The figure behind Gal gasped in shock, temporarily lowering the knife slowly and giving him time to escape. The figure behind him made an attempt to stab him in the back, tripped and fell downstairs with an ungodly amount of noise. Gal made a tenative attempt to see if they were alright, only to be knocked downstairs himself  by Laurael. After picking himself [and his stuff] up and checking for injuries [sadly Laurael had none] Gal examined the small pile of derbis that contained the would be assassin. What was most noticable was the large pair of feet sticking out. Large and clawed. Blue. \"Another Vorticon? Oh great, you're all insane!\" mumbled Gal heading off intent on locating an exit. This was made difficult by the fact that at the same time he was furiously drawing dragons on his sketchpad, something that usually calmed him down. [It was better than the medication, and he'd gotten much better since that time Percy Perks had to have that calico brush surgically removed from his nose.]These particular drawings also contained small blue creatures whose lives would be very short were they in fact in existence in the situations portrayed.

The landing went perfectly, however Keen had neglected to take into account the fact that he had been shot down over a rainforest. He dangled about 70 feet above the ground, trapped in the branches and tried to use his superior intellect to discern a safe way to descend. After a few miniutes he decided to use his pocketknife instead. This resulted in a very interesting 70 foot, 33 second journey exploring the various forms of rainforest ecology with special attention to dead branches and vines. The forest floor was unusually dark for someplace in the tropics, almost twilightic in intensity, and it was damp; everything glistend and dripped. Not that there was much to see; the entire forest floor was almost barren; only a few spindly saplings and the occasional fern struggled to survive in the near permanent blackness. Keen got up, dusted himself off [and found out that you could only do that with dust] picked a random direction and started walikng. The first law of fanfictioning dictated he'd find a town, or the base sooner or later.<br /><br />*meanwhile...*<br /><br />Lindsey sat in the middle of her private bedroom [#3, this one in the west wing] and concentrated. Once her breathing and heart rate had slowed she carefully placed the jeweled crown on her head. It immediately lit up with a faint purple glow. So far so good. A slight breze blew through the room despite the window being closed and it suddenly seemed to get cooler, darker. She held her hands out in front of her and began chanting the ancient runes. Silver sparks danced off her fingertips. \"<i>Dammit!\"</i> Lindsey rushed over to the curtains and beat out the small fire with her pillow. She kicked the ancient speel book into a corner despondently. She hated doing magic, and had ever since she'd started lessons at age five. She'd never seen the point, but fanfiction rules stated that any princess, queen or empress, especially those mentioned in computer games, had to know an ancient and mysterious form of magic. She was utterly useless at it of course but Mort had built her a wonderful armband that when surreptiously activated would make all sorts of mystic signs float in the air and even better electrocute any fans within visual range. She looked up as the door to her room creaked open. It wasn't the Vorticon, or the weird kid. He stood in the doorway with the light gently gleaming off assorted metal plating. <br /><br />\"Hello princess\" he said.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

There was no doubt abot what was being celebrated; the giant M's emblazoned acroos every banner and sign were a clue as was the big posters declaring it 'Dependence day' [In brazilian of course, but then, Keen knew seven languages after all.] The colorscheme was the usual red and black, matching Brazils new flag declaring it a state of the mighty McMire empire. Overcome with curiousity Keen pulled a celebrant aside. \"Hey; just when did Earth succumb to McMire anyway, and what happened to Commander Keen?\" The young man smiled \"Oh about a decade ago; just after President Bush ousted President Schwarzenegger to lead an unprecidented 4th term. And who is Commander Keen?\" Keen gritted his teeth. No matter what happened, this time around things would be different. If he had to saw his own arm off Bush would not get a 4th term. He mingled with the crowd, and joined the parade down the main street. He made it pretty far before this fanfiction caught up with him and he bumped into Najawa.<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Lorinda pouted. \"I don't see why Mom had to confiscate my blaster; its only a small hole after all.\" Andrew stood by the now somewhat less solid nursery wall and picked a small piece  of charcoal out of it. \"Well you shouldn't have been shooting inside, besides with your aim, if it weren't for gravity you couldn't hit the ground!\"  Lorinda gave Andrew a look that, if they could kill, would have nailed him to the floor. \"Huh. Its your fault we're stuck here babysitting anyways. You and your big mouth.\" Both looked around the sickeningly juvenile room they were imprisioned in [literally, Mort had instaled repulsion fields in the doorways.] Being part of the McMire residence it was mostly red and black [with cute dark grey rabid bunnies on the wallpaper.] In the corner Andrea had abandonded her pet zibble to ride something faster and more blue. Andrew had to contantly dodge her attempts to stun him. Obviously she had been around Lorinda too long. Lorinda sighed and looked around. \"Dar Lord this is boring; and not the usual kind of boring; this comes with the added enjoyment of sitting around with a bunch of six year olds, one of whom  is eight! I swear, I didn't think you could get bored to death, but this is at least managing boring me to sickness. Why doesn't anything happen?\"  <br /><br />No sooner did she finnish speaking then there was a loud thud at one of the walls. They stared at the door; there was nobody there. The clock still ticked away on the left wall and the toybox stood near the third; the bang had come from right behind them... Andrew looked at the charcoal in his hand, then at the wall it had come from. He stepped back just in time to avoid a shower of derbis. Lroinda groaned \"Thats the fourth time in as many paragraphs the fourth walls been broken! And Mom will blame me for this!\" The dust settled revealing a figure standing in the hole that had been stared by Lorinda's blaster and finnished by its chaingun cannon. Harvey Smith sneered. \"Blowing up a nursery, now thats what I call a good start to the week!\"<br /><br />Apparently Andrea hadn't been paying attention. She was now navigating right toward him. \"Gaiieee! Not more naked dogs! Why are there no cloths?!\" Then he collapsed. \"Wow, those vorticons sure are stunning.\" said Andrew, smiling at his own pun. The smile faded when a shadow loomed over him and placed a shotgun to his temple. \"Yeah,\" sneered Duke \"And now we're gonna have a blast!\"<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Currently both were showing in the form of a documentary about Morts contributions to unified field physics. Most of the 'gang' were here already [Mort himself was busy scribbling notes from the program, adding another layer to the paradoxes already present.] nearly all of them had been shot down, although OM himself had smashed his craft in a keenish maneuver. Appaently infiltration would be easier from a ground based assault. This made perfect sense once you thought about it, although why they had ho be blown up first eluded him. Around them the city bustled, caught up in the midst of the celebration. At leas the multicoloured costumes would disguise their prescence from whoever might be looking for them. Eventually the entire group arrived [Almost right after Mort had stopped taking notes, Keen noticed.] and they set out for wherever it was they were going. OM hadn't been at all clear about their destination, just that they'd be getting there on foot. ['So secret eve I don't know where it is' thought Keen] Thankfully the monotonus trip was both shortened and enlived by Keens pogoing ability. [And Najawa falling into a mud hole along the way.]<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />The years had not been kind to Duke; his constant steroid abuse had eventually caught up with him, reducing his body to a bloated red mass. [And, rumour had it shrinking his reproductive capacity to nothing.] He was overweight and balding, a far cry from his former good looks. A well placed kick reduced Andrew to his knees. Another kick sent Andrea and her mount skidding across the room with a yip and a yell. Keeping the gun trained on Andrew he swaggered boldly across the room, 'accidentally' stepping on Harvey, several times. \"Okay listen up,\" he boomed \"You're all screwed, but if you cooperate some of you will be less screwed then others. Now I-\"From her sprawled position against the wall Andrea tossed something sphereical and heavy sounding toward Duke. Without flinching he kicked it duly away. It was heavy, even Dukes powerful kicks only pushed it halfway across the floor. It rolled slightly and... opened its eyes. Duke stared at it. \"What the hell...\"<br /><br />\"Zeeky Boogy Doog\"<br /><br />It wasn't very well constructed, being poorly sealed and the micronuclear device being rather primitive, but a 6-year old genius was a 6-year old genius, and the explosion was still pretty impressive, forcing all free objects in the room against the wall. It would have destroyed the floor if it had been built by anyone but Mort. Andrew picked himself out of the derbis and punched the air \"Hah! Thats my sister! In your face!\" Duke who had been closer had been pushed almost through the wall groaned and got to his feet, the layers of muscle and fat cushioning the blow. Harvey had actually managed to go straight through, leaving a small oval hole, just like in cartoons. There was now a way out, Andrew eyed it, but his sibling was still trapped.<br /><br />Harvey groaned and opened his eyes; the first thing he noticed was blue; then the face above him came into focus. \"Hello\" said Laurael cheerfully.<br /><br />\"Aiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee!\"<br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

		"content": "Well, seems I should be continuing this doesn't it?<br /><br />*<br />Chapter 64: Pests<br />*<br /><br />The screens flickered excitedly in the semi darkness as proton watched them intently. Currently he needed 23 screens just to keep track of what was going on. He tapped his console irritably. 'Blasted pests; just like cockroaches, there's always more of them. Oh well, time to squash a few bugs hmmmm?' He tyoed a few commands and things started to happen.<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Gal tried the door again. Locked. Just like the others. He was starting to get a horrible feeling in the pit of his stomach, but he squashed it with a burst of logical resolve. Why would anybody lockl him in? He tried to gather his thoughts; his sketchpad was almost black with scribles now, he put it down, sat in a nearby chair, put his head in his hands and tried to <i>think.</i> Nothing was making sense, and for a chartered accountant that in itself was disturbing. There was a clatter and a familiar clip-clacking of clawed feet on the floor. \"Hey! Guess what? There's <i>another</i> vorticon here!' chirped Laurael At least now she was clothed, in a polkadot shirt and purple pants. Gal wasn't surprised at the color scheme. \"Thats like, three! Isn't that great? Isn't it? Huh? Huh?\" This was just too much. \"Look, lady, will you just shut up, or piss off!\" he growled shoving the Vorticon roughly. Laurael staggered, whimpered, then fell down, a small patch of blood appeared on her shirt and grew larger. Gal bent over to take a closer look, there was something on her chest that... 'Je-ee-ee-sus christ! What the hell?\" he yelled falling back. \"You- what the frick is that? Oh God, you've got stitches from top to tail! How can you be standing here?\" Laurael staggered uncertainly to her feet. \"You just popped a few stitches, I'm fine.\" \"Like heck you are! What'd you do? Have abdominal surgery?\" gasped Gal. \"<i>I said I'm fine!\"</i> Barked Laurael in a voice that suggested that any debate on the matter would involve the large number of sharp teeth she was now barring. And with that she ran off. \"Weirdo\" muttered Gal, stepping off the chair he had jumped on.<br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Another wave of mechainized death fell apon the group, only to be oblitereated by the blazing plasma cannons as the group pressed slowly forward in a haze of smoke and sparks. Suddenly a large pile of spare parts moved, a showed itself to be a robot; a very, very big robot... with lots of spikes and guns. Before it could even open fire Xky was apon it, blazing furiously at what was possibly the head, or a stubby arm. ON and his younger self were close behind while the others concentrated on finding another way forward. Najawa aimed a spinning kick at the droid- and smashed straight through it. \"What the...\" gasped ON \"This thing is armoured with... <i>paper mache?</i>\" There was a barely auidible click. Xky looked down at where he knew the device would be hidden; ON was staring up at him, a lot closer to it than he was. \"Xky,\" he said \"I always respected you.\"<br /><br />And then the room went white.<br /><br />Xky groaned and tried to focus, his mouth tasted of blood. Nearby he could see ON who had been much closer to the bomb than him. It wasn't hard, a lot of him was spread out in a lot of places. Xky tried to get up but something pinned him, he'd been close to the explosion and had been thrown against a wall, unfortunately the wall had a number of things sticking out of it now, hard things that didn't care if a soft piece of meat happened to hit him. He stared at the large steel pipe protruding from the left side of his chest and managed to wonder if it had cracked any ribs before his body realized he had no right to be consious and he plummeted into black oblivion.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

He stared at the scene for a while before the sound of Najawa coughomg up plaster broke the silence. \"Damn. He was the second best righthand man I ever had.\" mumbled OM. Najawa stared as OM crossed the room to the fallen body of his elder self, grabbed him by the hair; and picked up his head. \"Dude, thats, thats my friggin HEAD!\" OM calmly took out a ziplock bag and placed ON's head inside. \"Well, I owe his family a body don't I? He stared at the impaled body on the wall. \"Well, Xky always said to leave him where he fell.\" He chuckled \"Or at least in this case slumped. Skit, I guess we'll have to assume everyone else was caught in the blast. That just leaves us.\" He stared at Najawa for an uncomfortably long time. \"Dear God I'm depressed.\" The passage had been blocked by the blast but a hole had been blown into another corridor so they had no choice but to follow it.<br /><br />*On the other side of the pile of rubble...*<br /><br />Mort groaned and pulled himself out from under the slab of ceiling that had hit him. Nearby Keen was shaking wall fragments out of his shoe. \"Aaaah, what the hell happened? Not again! How many times to I have to get blown up today? Skit, I guess we'll have to assume everyone else was caught in the blast. That just leaves us.\"  Keen looked around, the derbis blocking the passageway behind them were pretty solid, and a few miniutes searching didn't reveal any other survivors.\" Warily they proceeded. As they walked off Keen paused \"Wait, do you hear something? I swear I heard... marching?\"<br /><br /><br />*Meanwhile back on the other side of the rubble pile...\"<br /><br />They came from everywhere, converging on the site of the explosion. They all marched in step beating their brums in unision. Slowly they clustered around the mess, sealing the hole in the wall and using the rubble to contruct a strong blockage across the passageway. When they were done the y simply marhed off in single file the way they had come. If anybody was there to watch they'd never have noticed that there was now one more of them.<br /><br />*Zipping back to OM's castle, we're going everywhere today aren't we?*<br /><br />Gal found Laurael imbeling a glass of oragne juice a few miniutes later. [Yes! I used an obscure word that means drink!] He approached cautiously, the day had tended toward his injury recently and he didn't want to push it. \"Hey blue chick, you dropped this card what with all the nudity and stuff.\" he said handing over a small square of plastic. Laurael gasped when she saw it. \"Gah! My family photo! I can't believe I lost it!\" Gal frowned \"Family photo? The whole cards just brown!\" Laurael gave the card a slurp. \"Chocolate sauce.\" \"Chocolate sauce?\" \"Chocoalte sauce. Helps it stick to anything, plus it hides what it is, plus it tastes good if you're hungry. Want some?\" Gal backed off. \"No thanks, I don't really like chocolate.\" Laurael advanced. \"Nonsense, everyone likes chocolate! Look, I haven't touched this side!\" \"No, no thanks, really.\" \"<i>Lick the damn photo!\"</i> Defeated Gal obeyed, feeling like an absolute fool while doing so. \"Hey, so this is your family? Those are your parents right? And... is that you?\" Laurael looked \"Nah. Thats my sister, Miss perfect.\" <br /><br />\"She's... breathing fire?\"<br /><br />\"Yeah, all chicks can do that where I come from.\"<br /><br />\"No kiddin! Geez, she's hot then!\"<br /><br />\"Hot? Oh I get it! As in fire! Haha! Nice joke!\"<br /><br />\"Umm, joke... yeah. So uh, what exactly are you doing here anyway?\"<br /><br />Lauraels answer was cut off by a crash in the next room. Both hurried to investigate. As Gal turned the corner he stopped cold. \"Mmm... mmmm\" he gasped.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

The mass murderer!\" Gal just stared at the scene in front of him, it involved a lot of red ink and torn paper. In the middle of the room lay a sketchpad, torn to shreds, with a snapped red pen stabbed through it. Standing over it was an evilly smiling vorticon, splattered with more ink. He looked up and noticed the two figures. \"Ah, you know me! Looks like I have two more to add to my score!\" He advanced menacingly, claws drawn. Laurael screamed and backed up, Gal simply fell to his knees mumbling. \"Mmm...mmmm\" His hands scribbled sketches with an invisible pencil, they were starting to itch. Suddenly he paused, then looked at the vorticon with hatred. \"Mmmy calico pen! <i>Do you know how hard it is to get red ones?!\"</i> He sprang at the grinning vorticon, snarling. Laurael backed into a corner and watched the scene with horror until Gal stopped screaming, it took a long, long time.<br /><br />*Meanwhile....*<br /><br />Andrew skidded around the corner, followed closely by Lorinda and Andrea. A thunk marked the loss of a small chunk of wall as Harvey's claws tore a chunk a meter long just above Lorinda's head. Slightly further back a string of swearwords stripped the paint as Duke reloaded his shotgun, just a bit later a rather larger hole appeared in the wall; Duke was gaining.The fleeing children turned another corner- and ran smack into Xky. \"Mom!\" gasped the vortikid leaping into the arms of the somewhat surprised Vorticon standing nearby. A short while later Duke and Harvey appeared. Duke lowered his gun. \"Nowhere to run now.\" he growled. The vortikid peeped out from behind its mother and growled \"They're trying to kill us Mr Xky!\" Xky cracked his knuckles and sighed. \"Always when I'm eating!\" he said, putting down his sandwich. \"Almost 25 years of right handing and I can't even finnish a snack in the home of my former employer. Granted, I broke in, but still... *sigh* Klip'd; would you hold this for me?\" With that he stepped forward and smiled. \"So it begins.\"<br /><br />[ZOMG! Xky? How? WTF?

Most people when they first awake suffer a momentary bout of panic as they ask themselves the usual questions; <i>where am I? Who am I? Who is <b>that</b> Why am I snuggling a barbie doll? <b>Oh god what did I do last night?!</b> </i> This is because everybody lives with just that small bit of uncertainty; a coiled silver spring in their minds. They spend all day winding it up, so every morning their brain has to do a quick spot check to make sure You didn't wander away in the night and Something Else take its place. This never troubled Xky who always knew who and where he was. Unlike most people he went from dozing to wide awake instantly. He stared at the chunk of metal protruding from his chest, took a deep breath, gasped with pain, and pushed himself away from the wall. There was a 'scloop' as he slid slowly of the impaling object and fell to the floor. He sat there for a while gasping and coughing up blood. Finally he took a deep breath and stood, slightly unsteadily, to his feet. He checked himself over for further injuries and was exceedingly grateful that he had been born with inversia, and thus had all his organs on the wrong side of his body. His left lung was punctured though; he wouldn't be doing any running soon, and he probably wouldn't be able to much at all without a projectile weapon of some kind, but if there was one thing his life had taught him, it was to stand by the family motto: Bark, bark bark bark , woof-yip. [A Rauh doesn't stop biting until their teeth fall out] He stared at the only egress left to him; the others would have assumed death, and there was no sign of them, but chances were, they went this way, either way; <i>someone</i> was going to pay for his injuries <i>with interest</i><br /><br />*Meanwhile...*<br /><br />Duke stared at the figure for only a second before bringing the gun around in a gentle arc that ended in the flicking of a trigger and the appearance of a large hole in the wall. Several smaller holes appeared as Harvey randomly shot anything non-Duke and dangerous looking. Where Xky had been however there was nothing but empty space; he was now a foot to the left of his former position. Once again Duke aimed and fired, and once again Xky somehow shifted. Duke aimed a hefty kick at the annoying figure, only to find it connecting with nothing but air. His steroid addled brain finally snapped, he dropped the gun and let loose with a flurry of punches and kicks. His body was slowed by steroid and drug abuse, his fighting style was unscientific and stood no hope of winning against either martial arts of military discipline. However it had won against both on account of the fact that it is very hard to develop a proper fighting plan when a 300 pound muscled maniac is using your head as a battering ram.<br /><br />Xky however was not using any technique remotely resembling either military actions or martial arts. He was simply being where the punches and kicks weren't; a superbly executed spinning kick combined with a short sharp burst of punches designed to reduce an opponent to a bruised crumpled heap worked perfectly, only somehow Xky was suddenly two feet out of reach. Duke's anger grew; it wasn't even as if the guy was <i>fast</i>; he just <i>somehow</i> seemed to never be where he should. More bullet holes appeared, some just grazing Xky as Harvey desperately tried to eliminate Xky, or possibly Duke [With him it was hard to tell] suddenly a large blue paw came out of nowhere and connected with his head; there was an odd *crrk* his neck bent, and Harvey crumpled At almost the same time Xky simply reached out and hit Duke, who fell to the floor. Both bodies lay where they had fallen, neither would rise again.<br /><br />Andrew squeaked \"Wow! That was awesome! Not even the Vortninja did <i>that</i>!\" Xky turned and looked at the children severely. *Droom;* kindly take these children to their rooms, its too dangerous for them out there. If you meet any... obstacles, I'm sure you know what to do.\" The vorticon gave a nod and a low growl, a small flame issued from her mouth and danced a cinquepace on the end of her snout. Xky smiled to himself. \"Ah, reminds me of old times; I really should've stayed in right hand manning, but I was so eager for new experiences back then, nevermind, at least now things get interesting.\"<br /><br />*Meanwhile somewhere else...*<br /><br />[Not that the last meanwhile wasn't somewhere else too, so, like, there are two Xkys here in different places, and it obvious one is from the future, or maybe not since the story didn't mention it, but anyway, they're in different places, and um, damn, I've screwed things up haven't I?]<br /><br />None of the other droids paid them any attention, few were intelligent enough to anyway, and besides, they had other things  to do. They came from vents and machinery, the congregated in dark hallways and marched toward their destination. If someone could somehow observe them from above and a distance they would see them converge, dozens of units forming into long lines, and each line converging on a moving point...<br /><br />All except one, this one moved to its own destination. It heard the digital commands being broadcast, but paid them no attention, instead it headed towards their source. Nobody noticed another unit, wherever it was going, it had been told to, it could not be otherwise. Even if it was wearing a wristwatch.<br /><br />Meanwhile the rabbotoid units moved onwards, listening to the invisible instructions they received moving to hidden commands. They didn't pause, didn't stop, they never would, even if the building collapsed, that is why they had been built, simple, effective and persistent. They headed toward their goal, cold and silent. And they kept coming and coming and coming...<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
