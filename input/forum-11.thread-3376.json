I love it.<br /><br />ClickBeat - [url=http://www.thephorse.net/beatclick/news/]www.thephorse.net/beatclick/news/[/url]<br />All about rhytm here. A stealthy game where you have to click the small circles that appear. In the meantime it's guided by music and background animation (very arty).<br /><br />I'll post the best new freeware games I know of every once in a while for you people to enjoy.

Free to play as much as you want, with the option of purchasing a registered version to join the community and play online (as far as I understand it).<br /><br />[url=http://www.trackmanianations.com/]TrackMania Nations[/url] In case you haven't played TrackMania, it's more or less a modern day incarnation of Stunts. There are, if I'm not mistaken, three commercial games currently available, but this one is completely free to download and play solo or online on a wide range of servers.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it as long as your hardware can handle it. If not, try turning down the settings and imagine it's an oldschool game. Although the graphics are indeed stunning, the gameplay is what makes it really shine.<br /><br />Finally...<br /><br />[url=http://www.pompomgames.com/]PomPom Games[/url] have some brilliant modern classics available. Although they're commercial games, the demos available are very enjoyable, and for $10 they're definitely worth supporting--especially since they're available for Windows, Linux and Mac!"
