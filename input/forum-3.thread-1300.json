So well - here they are!<br /><br />This is the first one, dunno when I drew it actually, but it was a long time ago.<br />One of the enemies is from 'Keen 2000' for those who doesn't recognize it... (Also, there's an apperance of an enemy from the lovely game 'Pandemonium'.)<br /><br />[img]http://img250.imageshack.us/my.php?image=keenwithenemiesth4.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br />---<br /><br />The second one:<br /><br />[img]http://img441.imageshack.us/my.php?image=keensketchql4.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br />---<br /><br />This is a, well, don't know what to call it actually. (I'm Swedish ._.)<br />This is On swedish to, so I guess I have to translate: (Just a reminder, I drew this when I was about 7 years old, so my Swedish-spelling really sucked)<br /><br /><br />The front and back of the 'book':<br /><br />[img]http://img441.imageshack.us/my.php?image=frontandbackofkeen4fw0.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br /><br />The first and second pages:<br /><br />[img]http://img441.imageshack.us/my.php?image=page12sa7.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"Keen is going to use the nuclear silo\"<br /><br /><br /><br />The third and fourth pages:<br /><br />[img]http://img441.imageshack.us/my.php?image=page34zs0.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br /><br />The fifth and sixth pages:<br /><br />[img]http://img166.imageshack.us/my.php?image=page56er8.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br />\"No, the glass is broken. He might die.\"<br /><br />\"Noooooooo, Keen Died.\"<br /><br />\"The End.\"<br /><br />---<br /><br />The last pictures is the last episode of a smal series I made.<br />I don't really understand so much myself, you see. ._.<br /><br />As I said before, have in mind that I drew this when I was VERY YOUNG. I'm not much of an artist now either... &lt;,&lt;<br />Well...Enjoy, and have a good laugh xD<br /><br />EDIT: I have enlarged the pictures."

There was some old DOS program you could use, like DosBox, but far simpler, you'd get a bitmap image every time you pressed F4 + F5 + F6. Those were the fun days of paint and messing about with cut and copy.[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Awww! Feel the love!"

		"content": "(garg, ezboard won't let me log in, so I can't edit posts.)<br /><br />And as for Keen drawings I've done, I made tons of levels with all sorts of clever ideas. The very first one was when I was like five and was inspired by some \"video game\" drawing that was hanging up on the wall of the dentist's office - the hygenist's nephew or something had drawn it. I remember the Keen level was drawn in marker involved some sort of mine cart on tracks that snaked down the page, and that was pretty much it as far as I can recall. I honestly do not know how I remember this - perhaps partly because my parents told me about it? But then how would I know what the level looked like? They certainly don't remember ... the mind is a mysterious thing ...<br /><br />Anyway, I graduated to drawing the levels with a pencil (more detail). I don't remember making any Keen drawings on the computer ... apart from a couple of screenshot tweaks, like LLa said.<br /><br />I also drew a couple of Keen comics - more like \"graphic novels\" I guess. The only plot element I can remember now is that some nasty creature snuck into Keen's B-w-B Megarocket and switched the labels on the LAUNCH and SELF-DESTRUCT buttons. Keen got in, pressed what he thought was the LAUNCH button, and ... I don't remember how he got out of this situation ... he didn't die anyway (\"SLUT\", lol).<br /><br />Wow, it's been fun thinking about this stuff.<br /><br />Edit: (now it lets me edit!) Next time I'm home I'll try to remember to grab some and scan and upload them. I probably won't though, to be honest.<br /><br />It was fun seeing other people's early Keen drawings! I'll try to reciprocate!"
