		"content": "I said there would be a full Commander Keen feature movie by 2004 and there wasn't... So I guess I'll hafta make one myself.<br /><br />In this forum topic, I don't really want expressions of interest or encouragement just yet, I want samples of people's voice acting.<br /><br />The characters are:<br /><br />Billy/Keen<br />Mortimer<br />Teacher<br />School kids<br />Mortimer's nerdy sidekicks<br />Bloogs<br /><br />Some notes on voices:<br /><br /><b>Billy</b> is a 10 year old boy, and as we know, he is from Milwaukee, USA. I don't know what a Milwaukee accent sounds like as opposed to a \"generic\" American accent (if there is such a thing), but Milkaukee is in the state of Wisonsin, kind of near Canada.<br /><br /><b>Mortimer</b> is Billy's age. I reckon should have a \"Southern Drawl\". Think Dr Loveless from the Wild Wild West movie. Also it'd be cool if his voice could sound like the whiny nerdy voice of Mandark from Dexter's Lab.<br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mortlol.gif[/img] <br /><br /><b>Teacher</b> doesn't have a name or a gender yet. His/her catchphrase is \"Oh, why do I even bother anymore.\"<br /><br />The <b>Bloogs</b> are stupid. They speak in dumb voices. This could mean stupid like the typical \"henchman\" deep voice, or it could be the higher, hyperactively stupid voice like GIR from Invader Zim, or Pinky from Pinky &amp; The Brain. There are a number of different Bloogs in this movie, so there can be a range of voices (and accents).<br /><br />I want to involve everyone in the Keen community in this... but only those have access to a microphone will be able to help, unfortunately.<br /><br />Once I've cast the voices for the main characters, it'll be up to you to get your parts recorded and sent my way and then begin the long wait as I animate it. It could take a few months, if not half a year, to get everything recorded and animated.<br /><br />If you can't get your voice samples hosted online, email them to me at<br />frencheroticfilm@gmail.com <br />(10MB file size limit)<br /><br />Know that by being cast you agree to leak NO details of the characters, script, or plot, on pain of something painful. It's all top secret, as is usually the deal with my movies.<br /><br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Andrew Kepple (Director/Producer)----------<br />The Chasm of Strife (deceased): www.ThisStrife.com/Sluggy/chasm.htm"

If you know anyone with a camcorder, you could use the soundtrack from that instead of a mic. That's what I do.<br /><br />If any of you auiditionees want to digitally affect your voice to make it sound more childlike, or more alien/robotic, please do so.<br /><br />Also, Spot has a small cameo role in this movie.

A movie about Keen with no Keen voice actor (or actress) wasn't going to get very far.  <br /><br />However, in recent months, TMST has hinted that things might be picking up again.  Having seen his flash movies on Newgrounds, and witnessed the fact that there's little girl voice acting in them, I'd wager TMST has found somebody's little sister to be a potential voice actress for Keen.  (In many animated features, little boys are voiced by women.  See Bart Simpson as a classic example.)<br /><br />Just a guess... :-)"
