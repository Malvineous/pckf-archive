It will be a keen 6 mod mostly set in the desert, but other than that the story/atmosphere is very open to ideas. so basicaly:<br /><br />1. Where do you want to the see the story go?<br /><br />2. What things do you want and not want to see?<br /><br />Im kind of hesitent about posting it in this sub forum, i dont know how much people look at it, oh well [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

The levels weren't impossible to complete, but also weren't just a walk-to-the-exit type of design either, if you know what I mean. Items and enemies felt well placed, and the actual level structure felt quite Keenish, so at the moment all I could recommend is more of the same.<br /><br />I am going to have some free time next weekend so I'm going to finish Krodacia and then I'll have something more useful to say here."

While I don't expect you to keep that in your mod, I would love to see the elevators being involved in your level design more than they were in Krodacia.<br /><br />As far as the desert goes, maybe we can haxx0r a palette patch for you--the base yellow and brown can only go so far, after all.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>  Or do you have other things in mind?<br /><br />I'm looking forward to how you reinvent each enemy.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>   Your monsters are always fantastic.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />I'll also be taking advantage of the bip controlled elevators in one way or another. They probably wont appear much in the desert, but I've been considering have some sort of robotic city levels where they would fit in great.<br /><br />I'd like to keep the orignal colors, I think a good desert combination would be yellow, brown, light and dark red, and maybe some grey. I'll post an example a little later.<br /><br />Most of the enemies in this will be based on their environments. Currently im workign on a killer cactus for the desert.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, I have no idea what Keen's mission/goal is besides getting off the planet. But how does he do it? by building a new bwb, getting rescued by someone, having to retrieve certain objects for someone? What would be the keenest way of escape?<br /><br />also, should the Krodacians return in the series, or are they a one episode deal like the shikadi?"

		"content": "I'm particularly looking forward to how you put the inventory items to use. Using the shuttle in a different context to Keen 6 might be a difficult premise (maybe an elevator, or a moon destination rather than a space platform). Now that I think about it, the satellite has a lot of Messie-style potential, especially if more than one is able to be used in the map.<br /><br />In short, I'd like to see a more complex map, with perhaps a bit of backtracking and plenty of stuff to explore. Krodacia's map was good, yet it was still fairly simple with the same basic one-level-blocks-access-to-a-group-of-other-levels structure laced throughout it. An area or two with several possible entries, like the ones that block the dome on the space platform in Keen 6, would be nice.<br /><br />I've not completed Keys of Krodacia yet, so I don't know how the story ends. Whether or not the Krodacians appear in this episode would depend largely on that. I would be inclined to say leave them out and create an entirely new creature set, or if you include them use only one or two and use them sparingly.<br /><br />My suggestion is to steer clear of the get-stuff-to-make-ship-work theme, as that's been done to death in the many Keen 1 mods. I don't know how versatile the winning conditions are in Keen 6. If it's possible to have several elements to the objective, that would be classy, especially if you can somehow incorporate the inventory items and such.<br /><br />That said, a general 'more of the same' about sums it up. Krodacia has a great balance of Keenishness, as did Perilous Pursuit. Keep that up and we'll all be happy I'm sure."

Havent really thought of a good way to use the grappling hook except as maybe some sort of latter. To be honest, I completely forgot about the satelite. I have an idea for it, but it wouldnt be secretive, it would be used similar to the way the shuttle is used in keen6. <br /><br />Since you've said it, i think backtracking on the map is a great idea, and I have some good plans for that. Keen 6 also has a HUGE tileset and I plan to dedicate a lot of it to special tiles just for the map. I'll also try to create differant paths to the finnish, rather than one straight way through.<br /><br />As far as the Krodacians are concerned, they most likely wont be in this episode, but im curious if people would want to see them in the episode after? <br /><br />With the way to win, ive been thinking about a few ideas. <br />1. Somehow involve lt. barker coming to resuce keen but getting captured himself?<br />2. Somekind of boss character, not associated with Mortimer. <br />3. Involving some other character from keen's past (princess lyndsey, oracle janitor, pet yorp).<br /><br />Which brings up an important question, should keen have to fight a boss character? Its been done three times in the keen series (vorticon commander is kind of a boss, Mangling Machine, king boobus Toober). Would this be a good idea, or not? (im definately planning to have a boss in the final episode [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mort.gif[/img]  )<br /><br />You can see I want to be really consistent with the orignal series [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-crazy.gif[/img]  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

Without the BwB, Keen has to find someway off the planet. Keen gets a message on his watch that Lt. Barker is coming with bwb to save him. But Lt Barker is captured on the planet's surface by some strange alien. The alien dresses like Commander Keen and thinks that he is commander keen, and thus wants to get rid of the real commander keen. Commander Keen's mission is to find this alien imposter and save Lt Barker so that they can leave the planet to find Mortimer.<br /><br />Keen will have to travel through deserts, cross rivers, move through caves, and sneak into robotic bases.<br /><br />I have two screenshots of what some of the desert levels may look like:<br /><br />[img]http://server3.uploadit.org/files/Ceilick-CK6PAT04.jpg[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://server2.uploadit.org/files/Ceilick-CK6PAT02.jpg[/img]<br /><br />And here is the alien imposter keen and the real Commander keen, can you tell the differance [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-disguised.gif[/img] <br /><br />[img]http://server2.uploadit.org/files/Ceilick-Boss1.jpg[/img]<br /><br />Yes those clouds are slightly modified from the ones in Keen 5 [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-korath.gif[/img] , any advice on what kind of clouds I should have instead is welcomed and needed.<br /><br />Also, the snakes eyes are currently the same as the Poison slugs eyes, I havent decided if I'm going to leave them that way or modify them.<br /><br />Any avice on the desert landscape, the point items, or the story is also welcomed.
