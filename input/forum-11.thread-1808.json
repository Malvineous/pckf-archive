I'm wondering if this is some sort of glitch or if it's actually meant to happen. Although I legally own the full version, the one I'm playing is actually a mix of the full-version hocus.exe and hocus.dat with the rest of it being the shareware program, because the shareware version worked on my computer but the full version didn't. So could it be some odd side-effect of combining the two versions?[hr]<br /><br />RocketJess, blasting off again!<br /><br />[url=http://www.geocities.com/rocketjess]The Dragonkeeper's Lair[/url]"

However, there are cheats which enable all the things you've listed. Perhaps it <i>is</i> the mixture of both versions causing something with the cheats to activate randomly.<br /><br />I haven't played Hocus Pocus for some time (didn't find it much fun) but I don't recall that sort of thing ever happening on purpose. It's interesting that one version of the game works and another doesn't. What sort of error did you get for the full version?[url=http://txv.shortcutman.net/pccw/][img]http://txv.shortcutman.net/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"

But the full version just briefly has the DOS window with no writing, then it vanishes after a second and nothing at all happens after that. I'm running in with Windows XP and I don't have DOSbox.

I know Jazz Jackrabbit will do the same thing running under Windows on faster computers. Perhaps you should consider DOSbox - it'll probably work there. I wonder why it's only the full version that does it...<br /><br />Did you buy the game directly from 3D Realms?[url=http://txv.shortcutman.net/pccw/][img]http://txv.shortcutman.net/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"

		"content": "Hocus did not have the most consistent art, part of which is probably because they didn't have the storyline or character design installed until a while into development. I mean, look at the instruction screen - Terexin is called Wizard, and the outfit used by his sprite is significantly less fancy than that used by the big pictures.<br />(The cover art looks more like someone was given the beta sprite, which had a generic Clydish outfit, and was told to \"make him look like a wizard\". Just a guess, but it seems likely, and it's not like much else in that picture was in the game either.)[url=http://www.dutchfurs.com/~haze/?cat=files&dir=files/pc/shareware]Free Jazz Jackrabbit games[/url]<br />[url=http://www.jazz2online.com/J2Ov2/]Downloads for Jazz Jackrabbit[/url]<br />[url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/]Discussion of Jazz Jackrabbit[/url]"
