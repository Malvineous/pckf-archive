If you would like to close your account, DO <br />NOT SEND <br />THIS MESSAGE ON. If you would like to keep your account, then SEND <br />THIS <br />MESSAGE TO EVERYONE ON YOUR CONTACT LIST. This is no joke, we will <br />be <br />shutting down the servers. Send it on, thanks.WHO EVER DOES NOT <br />SEND THIS <br />MESSEAGE, YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE CLOSED AND YOU WILL COST 10.00 A <br />MONTH TO <br />USE. SEND THIS TO EVERYONE ON YOUR CONTACT LIST. NOW YOU KNOW WHAT <br />TO DO. <br />PLEASE <br />DO NOT FORWARD THIS or REPLY. COPY THE WHOLE EMAIL. GO BACK TO YOUR <br />INBOX AND CLICK ON NEW AND PASTE.THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION Like <br />I said, <br />normally I don't touch this stuff, but I had a look on the internet <br />and its <br />actually true . On the 1st of november (next year) we will have to pay for the <br />use of <br />our MSN and email accounts unless we send this message to at least <br />18 <br />contacts on your contact list. It's no joke if you don't believe me <br />then go <br />to the site [url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1189119.stm]news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1189119.stm[/url] and see <br />for <br />yourself. Anyways once you've sent this message to at least 18 <br />contacts, <br />your msn dude will become blue. please copy and paste don't forward <br />cos <br />people won't take notice of it! <br />Have fun with your friends online! Look and sound great doing <br />it. Start with a video from Microsoft [hr][/quote]<br /><br />November 1 you say? Would that be November 1, 2007?
