The twisted webcomic lay before him, built from the corpses of deceased webcomics long gone. It had to be large of course, that made everything easier to put together.

Suddenly the lightning struck, pumping thousands of volts through dead nerves. The comic twitched, then began to register hits. TMST cackled madly as the twisted being began to move off its slab uttering dull moans of 'Duke want booze and B***es!\"<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
