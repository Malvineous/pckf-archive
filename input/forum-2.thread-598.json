Seeing a fair few posts in here where there're people talking about what they're doing without showing anything, perhaps that could be adopted here?"

I think we're too small of a community for this sort of thing to be a real problem. So, no, I don't think this idea needs to be enforced here. Plus, from what I've seen, all it leads to is a bunch of retarded posts by people saying 'omg you neeed to post picture or this thred will be closed omg 0_o' and no real progress is made.[center]<font color=\"MAROON\">TOUGH GUYS DON'T FOLLOW FADS</font>[/center]"
