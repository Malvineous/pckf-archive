Go into jump cheat and throw flower power while going up but <b>DO NOT</b> let go of the jump key. You will be slow down in jump speed![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]    Throw a flower power again (without letting of the jump key) and you will slow down more!![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]    throw one again (without letting of the jump key) and you will start floating down slowly!!![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]    throw another (without letting of the jump key) and your falling a little bit faster but not two fast. Throw one more (without letting of the jump key) and you will fall at an regular speed. This can make going into small areas much easier.<br />2. In the dream mines (or any other level where you can stand directly under an really skinny platform) and turn on the invincibility cheat and go under the platforms dropping to the fire. If you now throw a flower power in upwards it will go straight through the platform!!!![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]    (and you will be moved towards the wooden beam)<br />3. Jump towards a really skinny, slanted platform so that your stomach is touching the edge of the platform and keep going towards it. (doesn't matter how slanted it is it only matters how skinny it is; it must be <b>REALLY</b> skinny.) You will go straight through it!!!!![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]    Obviously it works a lot better with the jump cheat but it's probably not required<br />4. You won't need invincibility any more!!!!!![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]    If you jump onto an dangerous area and quickly jump off, you might not get harmed by it at all!!!!!!![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]    Some times you die when you try this though.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img]    This also works on enemies."
