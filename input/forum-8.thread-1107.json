[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]    It seems that Chogall appears every 2 years here. This year I'll be studying in a university too, I won't have time for mods, but I'm sure I'll be able to check the forums every 2 months at least. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]   <br /><br />BTW [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopekeen.gif[/img]    I'm no native english speaker, so I shouldn't ask, but what's that of \"I <b>never</b> visit this place anymore\"???<br /><br />...<br /><br />Considering my point, the admins have been very inactive lately, except for KeenRush (who posts and reads) and xtraverse (who only reads... and he also made a level for the K1 level competition). It looks like they (chogall, eK and Yorpy) abandoned the PCKF without a simple announcement (\"hey guys, I won't check the forums for 10 years because of my career\"). Worse, the only moderator (Snaily) hasn't appeared for a looong time, and again, he didn't leave a message. Yeah, maybe the admins thought that, since this is a very small community, no non-admin moderators are needed, but how come K:M has a non-admin moderator that's (almost) always active (KeenRush), apart from the admins (Andy and Xky)?<br /><br />If I were the admin, I'd have posted an announcement, that I won't be here for a year or 10, and blah, blah dah dah. We all happy, we know what happens, there's nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Um... maybe you don't worry about the great admins' inactivity anyway (by great I mean the oldest Keeners and those who control CC314 too). <br />[hr]<b>SM:</b> <i>\"I could go and write a page about the Theory of Relativity (or whatever it's called), but, what is the point if I don't know what the Theory of Relativity is?\"</i><br /><br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]"

If he returns, and that's a large if, it wouldn't be reasonable to expect him to do anything soon and I don't think he even would want to.<br /><br />You're pretty new so in a short summary: most people that are mentioned as admins and moderators on this site, only are so in name. They do not want to play an active role in the community anymore and admit that.-----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Falling.gif[/img]"
