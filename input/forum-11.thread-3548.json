I got it in the bundle pack with thief 1 but I haven't played that yet.<br /><br />So far I'm on the bank level.<br /><br />There's also this free expansion (you have to have original thief 2)  which I'm downloading right now. It's rather big though. Like 671.6 mb.[center][img]http://members.cox.net/aborlan/sig/signature2.gif[/img]<br />[/center]"

		"content": "Yeah, I've played all three of those, and Thief 3 as well. They're four of the best games ever. I'd really recommend playing them in order. I like Thief 1 best, and Thief 2, Thief 2x (the fan-made expansion), and Thief 3 are about even. I think the story is better when you play them in order, although Thief 2x could go anywhere in the sequence since it has a different main character and story line (although they nearly intersect!). Thief 2 is the only one I haven't beaten; I got stuck on the last level. I lost my saved games, so I'll have to replay it to that point soon. I can't go too long without playing Thief.
