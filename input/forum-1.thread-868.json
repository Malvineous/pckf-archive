I don't think much of Keen GBC as a quality GBC game or as a quality Keen game, but I do want to see the box and manual.  I got my version used from amazon.com, so I don't have the box or manual.  The link took me to commanderkeen.net, which no longer exists.  Does anyone know where I can download scans of the box and manual?"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />It had taken me so long to figure out about the shootable blocks, and there it was right in the manual...bummer.<br /><br />And it took a moderate effort to figure out how many points it took for a life when I was trying to beat the game w/out continues...and there's the number in plain sight in the manual. <br /><br />Their descriptions of the monsters are definitely terrible imitations of the real Keen monsters.  They seem to think that the Dood resembles Shelly and that Robo Red resembles the PC Robo Red.<br /><br />Too bad about all those missing pages, but what I did get was worth it.  Thanks again!
