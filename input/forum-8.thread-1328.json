I'd think<br /><br />And then you can create your own groups. Each Group must come up with rules.<br /><br />This could make for some really funny posting habits around here.<br /><br />Example Rules - You must talk with a dutch accent (I Loov Keen Four heez Gruen an Goold Helmut).<br /><br />Here are the General Rules: <br /><br />1) You must bear your society in your sig. Don't have a sig yet??? Make one.<br /><br />Group leaders will offer links to sigs.<br /><br />2) Anybody who disobeys rules will be ostrigized<br /><br /><b>Tough Guys Wear Pink Rules:</b><br /><br />1) You must use the same avatar I use in my sig,  though u can keep your avatar.<br /><br />2) You must respect ladies (Tough Girls)<br /><br />3) NO MORT EMOTES!!! They are evil tokens of the Evil Geniuses wear black society<br /><br />4) You must be cheerful<br /><br />5) Gimmi $10<br /><br />6) Rule 5 is optional<br /><br />8 ) Woops, missed 7, oh well...<br /><br />9) Be nuteralistic; \"The glass is just as empty as it is full\"<br /><br />Well, who's siding with who???Proud Leader of the \"Tough Guys Wear Pink\" Society<br />[img]http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a371/najawa/Modding/LLMod.jpg[/img]<br />\"Tough Guys Wear Pink!!!\"<br />-- NAJAWA --"
