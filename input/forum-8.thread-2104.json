		"content": "Yeaup. Well... I got bored so I uploaded all my art to my website. FEEEEEL free to look. I only ask that you don't download TOO many 10+ Megabyte PSDs.<br /><br />(All art on here is  me obviously except for the stuff that isn't mine... obviously.)<br /><br />[url=http://www.blegdandsmeeg.com/art/]www.blegdandsmeeg.com/art/[/url]<br /><br />All this art coveres the time JUST pre-dating the time I joined the PCKF up to current. (That means now.) I labled all the folders with a \"1\" in front as to keep them all at the top of the page. All I did was link directly to the folder so it might dislay differently depending on what browser you are using.<br />(HEY! If anyone wants to help me out and make a PHP script that displays the contents of the folders in a nice GUI, be my guest... Thumbnails a plus. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-oops.gif[/img]  )<br /><br />There is some interesting things on here... including a Commander Keen comic I never finished that I drew on paper when I was in like... 11th grade.<br /><br />By the way, I have all of the \"Tzen\" comic on there because LevelLass said she was going to delete the webpage... well I didn't want that to happen so I saved them all into my art folder. (Why not? They are great!) So all Tzen comics  Sarah... not me.<br /><br />I ALSO should admit to the PCKF/LOL comic. What I did was I took all the PCKF member's avatars, cut them up and made a comic out of it poking fun at the various things that go on here and the members.<br /><br />FIRST OFF I would like to apologize to anyone I made fun of / used in the comic. It is all meant as a joke. Don't take offence to any of it. With that said... apologies do NOT go out to the following people:<br /><br />Rorie<br /><br />Well onto the comic!<br />[url=http://www.blegdandsmeeg.com/PCKFlol/]www.blegdandsmeeg.com/PCKFlol/[/url]<br /><br />I know I told quite a few of you about it although I never mentioned it publicly. Well whatever. Here it is now. I am SURE all of these comics made sense when I MADE, them even though the jokes of some even escape me now. Strange.<br /><br />Click on \"First\" to be taken to the beginning. (DUH!)<br /><br />Enjoy.-----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."
