The guy blames EA for having nudity in Sims 2 which is half false and that he thinks EA is cooperating with modders with these nude patches. I think the world gets dumber as each day passed by. I researched this guy on wiki and I now think that he is a bit of a lunitic.<br />[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Thompson_%28attorney%29]en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jac...ttorney%29[/url]<br /><br />And also he likes to bash gamers even if they are supporting his opinions.<br />[url=http://aelon.net/2005/07/jack-thompson-straw-man/]aelon.net/2005/07/jack-th...straw-man/[/url]<br /><br />Anyways this may prove to be a good discussion for us Keeners.Check out my blog at [url=http://spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/]spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/[/url]<br />Check out my fanfics at [url=http://www.fanfiction.net/u/680124/]fanfiction.net[/url]"

Doesn't it bother anyone that nearly all the enemies in Keen are <i>naked</i>??! And Id even had the gaul to put a swearword into their games! And even Keen himself, someon who should be a rolemodel to our children, will moon, yes <i>moon</i> the player in Keen 4! This disgusting and depraved practce is only being aided, with no doubt, Id's full consent, by modders. Did you know Xtraverse himself placed seminaked men in one of his mods? Or that the 'Paperface' mod contains, of all people, Britney Spears in an attempt to seduce our childrens innocnet minds!<br /><br />This must stop. I am petitioning Id to ban the sale, distribution and modding of this sick little 'game'.

Now what I find funny is that we were revealed some little information about the game and only 3 screenshots but from what I heard you stand up to bullies. Now why would they want to ban a game like that? To say that we should let bullies push us around? They keep on comparing it to colimbine incident but from what I've seen I dont see any guns or killing. Though yeah there will be violence in the game because you are fighting bullies but I dont see killing based on the screens. Yet I could be wrong about the game since I dont know if the violence is brutal or not yet why do I feel that if they want to ban this game would all these protestors want kids to get beat up by bullies? Then again I can be wrong about the game. I only read a little bit about the game so if you are actually a bully in the game then yeah I can see the issues about it.<br /><br />edit: Actually nevermind then I just read that you are actually a bully.
