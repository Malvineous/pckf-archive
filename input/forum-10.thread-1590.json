Sin City did this awesome black and white thing with bits of color and overdramatized constantly.  It also presented things very simply to go along with the fact it was based on a comic book.  And of course, it was overly violent to the point of being undeniably fun.  Dismemberments and blows the head galore.<br /><br />Also, I would like to take this moment to say how much I hated Kill Bill.  That is just if no one saw Sin City to comment on it, maybe they can agree with me that Kill Bill really really sucked.  Expecially that second one where there was no blood.*** ---   I Am Keen is hell bent for leather.  Are you?   --- ***"

Right now, it feels sadly to me like Nancy's life had climaxed with Hartigan's story - but we are supposed to find out more in Sin City 2.[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Just remember that this is the year of the elite devil.<br /><br />1337 + 666 = 2003[hr][/quote][img]http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3852/sheepsmall0sf.jpg[/img] <br />[url=http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/blacksheep/trailer/]trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/blacksheep/trailer/[/url]"
