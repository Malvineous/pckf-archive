Ive tried running ck4 on dos, ive downloaded emulators like DOSBox, and Ive fiddled about with memory and stuff like that on my computer. However, every time I run commander keen 4 and above the screen flickers horribly. I have tried using the screen flicker and VGA thing on the in game options but it still flickers! I really hope someone on this forum can help me out and I hope I can become part of the keen community.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Mike"

Lowering the cpu cycles seems to reduce the amount of jerkiness, though.
