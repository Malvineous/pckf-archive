We all hop in the car, and end up in France (I don't know why I didn't relize I was dreaming yet; I live in the United States). We go to an amuzment park, and I go on a roller coaster, which turns into an airplane ride over the pacific. I instantly fall through the plane, and see the words \"No Clipping On\" appear over my head. My first dreamish though was that my brother had sneaked on the pc when he shouldn't, but then I relized his debug keys wern't active (I still don't believe it, but it felt sooo real). Then I was underwater, and then I sort of realized I was dreaming... I then relized, that because it was a dream, I could breath underwater. I was enjoying breathing the water till I woke up.

I've had a few of those. It is sooo weird.<br /><br />(This is my first post here, but I'm an active member at Keen:Modding)<br /><br />-- NAJAWA --<br /><br />Edit: I changed the title of the post due to the ange of topics posted. they do follow a logical flow, but the previous title, \"Now this is weird,\" just wasn't good enough anymore."
