And unfortunately, drawing up all the 3d sprites and textures is a daunting task.  I've only finished 6 characters, and have done varying amounts of work on 5 others.  I've drawn a fair amount of textures, possibly enough to begin mapping, but there's a lot that have not yet been edited. And, of course, I HAVEN'T begun mapping yet, so...if I try and do this all alone, it will take a LONG time. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-oldy.gif[/img]   <br /><br />I've come to the conclusion that, if I want to see this finished, I'll probably need help with it.  So if there's anybody who has experience with Doom mapping and would like to help, then I would REALLY appreciate the assistance.  Also, I would appreciate help with drawing textures and probably also the sprites.  Those, at least, are similar enough to drawing for Commander Keen (since I'm drawing the whole thing in a cartoon Keenesque style).  Again, help would be loverly!<br /><br />EDIT: Screenshots coming shortly.  Maybe..."
