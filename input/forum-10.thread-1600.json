I thought it was awesome, I didn't like everything about it, but I liked 90% of it. Most people I know didn't like it, only 61% of critics liked it (according to Rotten Tomatoes) but I saw it anyway with an open mind and still liked it.<br /><br />I think the people who didn't like it, had 2 ideas in their minds. (1.) They didn't understand the story and (2.) They expected a rehashed Spidey 2. But instead Sam Raimi (the director) took some risky moves, instead of making another \"villain rises up, spidey defeats it\" formula movie, it had new elements to offer (which I am hearing critics saying Shrek 3 follows a formula too much, though I'd have to see it myself to decide).<br /><br />To quote Peter Travers who reviewed Spidey 3 for Rolling Stones: <b>\"My guess is that when the summer blockbuster season finishes pummeling us with formula, Spider-Man 3 is going to look like one of the few that was touched by human hands.\"</b>"
