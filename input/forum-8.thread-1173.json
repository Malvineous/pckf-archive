(wich i find good, better to release bug free tools)<br /><br />here is some kickass info<br />[url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/news.php?aid=8693]www.gamesindustry.biz/news.php?aid=8693[/url]<br />[url=http://www.clickconvention.com/2004down/tgf2.pdf]www.clickconvention.com/2004down/tgf2.pdf[/url]<br /><br />it might be old news for some but since i could not find anything on this forum regarding MMF2 or the release of MMF2 i decided to make a simple post.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-crazy.gif[/img]  yummy<br /><br /><br /><br />one important thing i would really like to hear about is if there is any way to build a library that stores all behaviour togheter with the objects. i so miss that funktion in old MMF. imagine a frame that acted as a library (or maybe even an external file), storing all the objects available togheter with all it's behaviours and then you could simply create another frame, pick the objects from \"libary browser\" and place them in the new frame and they would respond completely like they where set up in the library frame.<br />in the old MMF, if you wanted advanced movements and behaviours you had to copy parts of the code of the whole frame to get all the information about the behaviour wich caused lots of duplicated data in the project.<br /><br />some sort of reference library would be nice. one single object and the clones will be references (graphics and behaviour)."

For example, the image editor will be more like TGF's, as you can see.

Also, the people at Clickteam said TGF2 or MMF2 would come out as soon as summer 2006. w00t.<br /><br />About standard movement capabilities: I don't know if these are improved. I never use them though, as they always sucked before and you can do so much more with making them via events.

We are in the process of converting all extensions to the MMF2 format (and making a lot of new really groundbreaking extensions), but there are some extensions to which the source has been lost and the developer out of contact and we simply cannot replace.  You will have to modify the code in your applications so that they do not use these extensions.  There will likely be more updated and functional extensions that can do the same thing as those that will be lost, however, so I wouldn't worry about it.[url=http://spatang.com/ck][img]http://spatang.com/ck/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [url=http://spatang.com/cosmo][img]http://spatang.com/cosmo/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [url=http://spatang.com/nukem][img]http://www.spatang.com/nukem/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [img]http://spatang.com/scrobblersig.php[/img]"
