I don't like \"Goodbye\" topics. I think they are lame.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />I was talking to my brother a few days ago and he said something like \"Hey, what about the people you know online? You telling them you are leaving?\"<br /><br />I responded with \"Not really... I was just going to leave...\"<br /><br />He said \"Well that's MEAN!\"<br /><br />And you know what? It is.<br />So for what it's worth... here we are. I'm leaving in a week or so... on the 21st of august. Bye. It was a fun... like... year and a half.<br /><br />'Tever. It's not like I am disappearing or... dead. (yet)<br /><br /><br />Oh what am I leaving for you ask? (And if you didn't who cares! No one asked you.)
