Why doesn't the sign over the rayguns translate into French or Greek? Why English?

		"content": "The Standard Galactic Alphabet has not been around long. It has existed for barely a few years.<br /><br />Before SGA, many people spoke omnispeak; an oral language without any written form, it consists of a mere few hundred words and phrases, and is easily learned, being designed specifically to allow disparate species to communicate important things, like the fact that their ship was on fire.<br /><br />Things changed not more than four years ago, when a new and powerful empire began to rise, capturing many worlds and enslaving their inhabitants. While speaking omnispeak, they also spoke and wrote a new language, known to them as 'Sezzleck Galaxie Alfbezz' or SGA. This was a language very different from what they had spoken previously, written in 26 symbols, without punctuation. It also had a strange resemblance to a language spoken and written in some continents on the planet Sol III (Known by its inhabitants as 'Earth')<br /><br />As the Shikadi empire grew in power and influence, the SGA began to appear galaxy wide, though often not without a fight. Oddly, the Vorticons accepted this language remarkably fast and were all speaking it within six months as 'the will of the Grand Intellect.' With such support, the language was soon understood by almost everyone in the galaxy, though its origins remain unknown...<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Cute bunny!"

		"content": "It's fun to come up with rational ideas about the reasons behind the canon facts in the Keen Universe. The way I see it, there are two possibilites:<br /><br />-Najawa's idea, namely that aliens somehow planeted their language (English) long ago (I never thought of that).<br />-my idea, which is that Mortimer was the one who invented it after going to live with the Vorticons (which is how he learned advanced science and later got in control of them and in possession of advanced equipment to escape and become independant); the idea of a standard alphabet had been around for a while, and Mortimer was greatly in favor of it. Several character scripts were voted upon, and Mort's won. He decided to use English vocabulary to spare others the work of coming up with new words (though not always using the same spelling, since that is very unstandardazied in English). The SGA was only needed for important, priority information, such as exit and danger signs, in order that everyone could read and understand such things without having to learn a full language from another world, which was frequently very difficult. It would have no grammar beyond nouns, subject's, objects, and verbs, (simple to learn) because it was only used for labling things and wouldn't need complicated cases for personal pronouns and whatnot. Oh and an SGA hadn't been implemented yet because beings visiting other beings' homeplanets was not widespread until around the time Mortimer came to the Vorticons.<br /><br />I hope that's all feasible; if you want a real challange, try explaining the \"this is neat\" signs lol, or the candy everywhere, or the candy in the shape of SGA letters. NO, NO, how about Keen standing in the clouds (Keen 3)! lol.<br />\"Out of curiosity, what is that score in the Earth measurement system?\"<br />\"...That would be three hundred fifteen.\"<br />\"Three hundred fifteen...

This means that only keen is affected by the waste, immobilising him; however due to the short half-life of the materials involved, the materials spontaneously combust after a short period of time, leaving keen free to move around again.<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img] <br /><br />---Freeyorp"
