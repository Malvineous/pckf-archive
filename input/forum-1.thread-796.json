		"content": "What version of Windows are you using, and what are the specifications of your machine?<br /><br />Modern computers have trouble running old DOS games, not always because of Windows but often due to hardware incompatibilities. If you're running something that's above 1GHz (maybe a bit less might work), check out .[url=http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/]DOSBox[/url]. <br /><br />Once it's installed, create a shortcut to dosbox.exe on your desktop or somewhere else that's easily accessible, and drag any DOS executable, like keen1.exe, onto it.<br /><br />It might need reconfiguring if things run a bit slow. Ask if you need any further help."
