Eh but maybe I could try it but I doubt it could happen since I'm busy with dimension chaos (I will finish it dammit even if it takes years!). Still its a thought that could work.The end is near.

		"content": "Hmmm I like it so far. Even though the acting is pretty bad I think the script is really good(it's excusable for middle schoolers). Although I think they could of done a better job with the Scumm Bar. It keeps true to the game a lot. Definitely one of the better games to base a play off of.<br /><br /><br />But this \"Keen play\" you speak of intrigues me... The only problem I see is the apparent lack of stuff happening besides pogoing, shooting and... eating candy(Same problem I have). You would have to take lots of liberties in making it. No matter how you look at it none of the characters have that much depth. Take for example Princess Lindsey. She is a princess of... what? The Gnosticine race? I dunno.-----------------------<br />\"The Adventures of Commander Keen\" issue #1: coming soon."

SCUMM stands for Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion.  There's a Wikipedia thing on it [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM]here[/url].

		"content": "One thing you've got to keep in mind is that a print encyclopedia isn't infallible either, and won't get updated as quickly. Another is that controversial topics are the ones most likely to be vandalized to support a particular view, and that solid facts (conductivity of aluminum?) are likely to be correct. You can never trust any one source on a controvarsial topic, so I don't see the Wikipedia as being at a disadvantage. Also, the hordes of compulsive recent updates list readers help keep it very accurate, for the most part. I've found it to be a reliable reference and a good starting point for a lot of research.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/YorpEye.png[/img]"
