There is no trinity; instead Jesus and God are seperate.<br /><br />3.) Blood is life, don't eat it.<br /><br />4.) Its nice to use Gods personal name [Jehovah] for politement.<br /><br />5.) 'Christian' holdiays are crap and there's no point celebrating them [but you can if you want]<br /><br />6.) There's no association between the cross and worship, don't adorn your homes and churches with such outdated symbols.<br /><br />7.) Gods right to rule has been questioned.

Afterall, we can't be very certain about afterlife and that kind of things, stuff about eternal punishments or such may be just work of greedy churchmen to gain more control. I'm more than sure about that. What I am saying is that many things have probably changed during the history. Some writings altered, some stuff completely made up by loosely basing it on Bible (if even that) -- living proof of this is how half of the Christians think that \"it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of every creature to be united to the Roman Pontiff\" (line taken from Wikipedia's Pope entry) and the other half believes that one needs to just accept and believe in Christ and that's all.

He was a good man, the son of God and his sacrfice was great. He did a lot of good and led many to the lord. But we do not pray to him, only through him, for he is not God.

		"content": "Killed on a steak?  I think you mean \"stake\"( oh well, I guess I'm a perfectionist!)<br />  So what does that verse and other ones like the famous John 3:16 or a whole bunch of other ones like John 10:9(\"I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved\") mean to a Jehovah's witness?  To a Christian they mean He is God and that you have to ask forgiveness from Him to receive eternal life, but you say there isn't even any eternal life, so what does it mean?<br />  <br />Just ONE MORE question...  What does John 1:1-14 mean to you?  I'm asking because I have to memorize it for my school.<br />John 1:1 \"In the beginnig was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word WAS God...\" and later on in verse 14...<br />\"The Word became flesh and made its dwelling among us we have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only whocame from the Father, full of grace and truth. John testifies concerning Him...\" and it goes on to say John is testifying for Christ in later chapters, but you say that Christ is the Son of God. So what does it mean to you.<br />  <br />  Don't think I'm trying to reconvert you or something.  I know(as you already said) that you do not make this decision lightly and that you must of studied all these verses before you made your decision.  Of course, when somebody makes up their minds about something(whether they're Christian, Jehovah's witness, or anybody) noone can change their mind.<br />We could have Billy Graham in here and it probably wouldn't change too much. Even Jesus didn't convert all those Pharisees and stuff!  People can be really stubborn, which can be a good thing or a bad.  Some people aren't stubborn, just closeminded and foolish(you hear the word \"fools\" alot in Proverbs and stuff!)  Jesus did all sorts of miracles and signs, and people just ignored it. Evidence can slap people int the face and they'll STILL be foolish (*ahem* Lordofglobox* cough*)<br />So that's pretty much all I have left to say. Thanks for reading all this.<br /> P.S. (I'm not trying to call you foolish[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] )"

But still divine somehow, for he could perform miracles and stuff.<br />2. There is eternal life, but only if you want it and believe in God. Otherwise you will just cease to exist.<br />Am I correct?<br /><br />Anyways, these things don't really make sense to our minds. I don't really care whether Jesus is God's third part or God's human son, only thing that matters to me is that he's a saviour that can be trusted.<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"

This is an english translation. A number of translators however do not use this translation. For example, <i>A New Translation of the Bible</i> says: 'The word was divine' <i>The New Testament in an Improved Version</i> 'The word was with God and shared his nautre' <br /><br />In this context it can be seen that although the word was great, it was not God himself. [It shared his nature, was divine, but not Jehovah] Two seperate existences. <br /><br />In verse 14 it says 'the one and only who <b>came from</b> the Father ' again, two seperate existances.<br /><br />Jesus is still central to my belief the only difference is Jesus is not Jehovah himself, but his Son.<br /><br />This also brings up the interesting factoid the Jehovah is neither male or female, buy above gender ['He' invented reproduction.]<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]P.S.
