Then for a few months I spent alot of time inside and soon started searching the Web for Keen stuff, which obviously proved fruitful.<br /><br />I had a vague idea that the spleen correlated with a chakra, and had something to do with humour and such, and since it was such an easy pun I used it as my username.<br /><br />As it turns out, the Spleen/Sacral chakra is the centre for creativity, intuition and general amusement, and is attributed to the colour orange, which I had been obsessed with for several years, to the point of purchasing a tracksuit composed of varying shades of yellow and orange (I intend to recreate this outfit someday, instead in the form of a suit--haven't found the necessary components in an Op-Shop yet, though).<br /><br />As for the avatar, I used it simply because it represented the mod I had begun work on (and still am working on), and I haven't really found the need to change it yet.<br /><br />My age is 21 and 11 days.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />The development of the hardware, and the greater ability to express every idea that flies into a programmers head, mean that game creators have made the new games congested with every technique in their power. The basic games behind all this are so blurred that people cant catch up. We should go back to basics  like Pac-Man  and play in an easier, more relaxed way. -Toru Iwatani<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
