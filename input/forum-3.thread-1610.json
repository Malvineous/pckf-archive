And ok ok the belt *is* a bit low... I know. So sue me.) when the dude next to me looks over and says \"Dude are you drawing a furry?\" <br /><br />My immediate reaction was \"NO!\" I tried to explain that it was a Vorticon from Commander Keen and that they are supposed to be aliens. But he told me that it doesn't matter if Vorticons are suppose to be aliens, they are still furries. People make furries be aliens all the time in comics and stuff.<br /><br />This got me to thinking. (Evidently something that I need to do more...) So when I got home I looked up what [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry]Wikipedia[/url] had on furries. Vorticons DO fit the criteria that they have on there.<br /><br />I can't decide either way... I used to think that Vorticons were just aliens and totally not related to furries. Now I see how they could be mistaken for furries. Do you think that Vorticons are furries? I can't come to a conclusion.-----------------------<br />\"Tough guys wear pink\"<br />[img]http://img455.imageshack.us/img455/8978/mod21gb.jpg[/img]<br />\"But fat people STILL buy lots\""

Novels about furred aliens used to be sci-fi, now they're furry literature. Vorticons used to be aliens, now they're furries.<br /><br />The term furry now pretty much covers anything that resembles an animal in any way. Thus now even 'bunny girls' [women wearing bunny ears] are furry, as are old classics like <i>The Fox and the Hound</i> It has even encompassed anthropomorphic lizards and fish.<br /><br />As such Vorticons are Furries by association, not definition [You could say they're forced furries; would you like it if aliens landed, took over your planet, freed it, then told you you were a 'Xychar, some kind of comic book character?] However if you were to draw Vorticons with the intention that they were furries, they would be.<br /><br />If you want to see real Vorticon fury, tell Laurael her tail is drooping.<br /><br /><br /> A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Looking at the way the Vorticons appear in a close-up at the end of Episode 3, their ears are droopier, their eyes much more square-ish, and they don't really show their midsection or sag their jumpsuits.  :-)  The way you've drawn your character is basically an adolescent girl with an oversized head and big cat ears.  That's very furry.  <br /><br />That said, I agree that the Vorticons fit the definition of \"furry,\" although I'm a firm believer that art style and personality has a large part of what makes a person/idea \"furry.\""
