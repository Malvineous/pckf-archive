Truly, only Australia could produce someone of his ilk.<br /><br />Women: Not really appreciated on the international beauty scene [its the facial hair] they keep the Australian ecconomy stable by ensuring that Australias staple foodstuff and major export [beer] is always being consumed.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
