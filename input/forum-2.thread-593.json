If anyone wants to edit or complete it, feel free to do so [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] .<br /><br />Unfortunately, I never got the time to finish it myself. It is different from the demo i released (1 year ago :S) and features more levels, which I have put A LOT of work into... maybe too much [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] .<br /><br />All the secrets within the levels are revealed, and marked with special tiles. I used them while editing.<br /><br />The .rar also include pre.bmp &amp; end.bmp which I never implemented in the game. There should also be a working version of various modding/editing tools I haven't deleted :S. Also a lot of other files which ain't used.<br /><br />I present you; ALIEN VS KEEN 0.01:<br />[url=http://www.savefile.com/files/9162261]AvK[/url]<br /><br />Enjoy.-------------------------------<br />If something's HARD to do, then it's NOT worth doing. -Homer J.
