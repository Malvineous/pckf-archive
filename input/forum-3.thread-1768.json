[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br /><br />So, what about that thing? The text on the back-cover says, that this German comic was made by Hans-Jrgen Kelkel in january 1992. The title \"Commander Keen und die heilige Blume\" means \"Commander Keen and the holy flower\". The story plays in 2491 and Keens full name is \"Kasimir E. Keen\". There are many aliens and robots in the comic, but not anyone is from the games. Keen doesn't even wear his famous helmet, as you can see on the cover. So I don't know, either the name is only coincidence.
