I always assumed it came at least after Keen 4.<br />[hr][/quote]<br /><br />My theory is that Id Software licensed the vanilla Keen: Galaxy engine for Apogee. By \"vanilla\", I mean a source code distribution that was later heavily modified to produce the released Keen Dreams, 4, 5 and 6 games. The main modifications might be the menu screen layout (changed only in Keen Dreams), the level-entering mode (Keen Dreams and Bio Menace display a progress bar when you load a level), the physics system (Bio Menace and Keen Dreams share a more standard, less Keenish system), the cheat activation mechanism (Keen Dreams and Keen 6 v1.0 don't require an activator, while later versions of Keen 4-6 and Bio Menace do), and the text screens (in Keen 4-5 you have a red background with the yellow line bitmaps read from EGAGRAPH, while in Keen 6 v1.0 you have a gray background, v1.4 has a plain red background, and Bio Menace uses blue background with the line bitmaps read from EGAGRAPH too). However, most of the physics system, sprite manager, tile manager and tile map/TED5 format I/O system, remain unmodified between the games in question.<br /><br />That's what leads me to think Id licensed a vanilla source code distribution for Bio Menace. Also, it's possible, since Keen Dreams was developed later IIRC, and only for Softdisk, that they used the same distribution with minor modifications (for Softdisk likings) to produce the Keen Dreams engine, and they didn't have enough time to put the pogo in and such things.<br /><br />(BTW, you can see this vanilla thing if you compare the differences and similarities between all WinXP/.NET editions; Home Edition, for instance, has a mangled networking subsystem.)------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].

When you start the freeware version, you get a screen with some technical help for when you have problems with the game. I don't get this helpful screen in the other v1.1 version of Bio Menace. I guess the freeware release version is from a time after their \"We hate cheats\"-period, so they enabled the cheats again.Groeten van Frenkel<br />Visit [url=http://www.sfprod.cjb.net]The Official S&amp;F Prod.
