It could be submerged with about 20-30 feet of water, lots of old buildings and near coast will be destroyed completely, lots of people could die, and also, they are saying that coffins will start floating around with sewage, toxic substances and building debris to create a mass of deadly bacteria in the water and contaminate the whole city. don't act surprised when 100's of years of history is lost, along with one of the oldest cities in the country and tons of homes. get ready to be in shock.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />I hope nobody on here lives in New Orleans, because their home could be destroyed.

Lots of people in New Orleans called 9-11, approx. 5 per minute. I heard the figure that 150 people with cell phones called on their roof. Others probably weren't so lucky, lots got \"out\" of the city.<br /><br />I also heard EARLY on that some old buildings were destroyed.<br /><br />There's no footage of the part that flooded, that I can see right now<br /><br />Oh wait here's some<br /><br />Yeah the water is very deep. They're saying damage by the storm as a whole could total $16 billion, but I heard that early on.            French Quarter has been messed up.<br /><br />Katrina moved to the east just before impact, it's the only thing that saved New Orleans from total devastation. Still really bad though."
