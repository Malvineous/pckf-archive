There are many games (Super Metroid, Super Mario World 2, Kirby Super Star, Sonic 2/3) from the time period which the SNES was alive which feature tight gameplay, stellar atmosphere, and memorable music... all without use of polygons.  The early-to-mid nineties was by far my favorite era of gaming.<br /><br />The PS2 has hosted a far larger (and more diverse) library of games, but I feel it is only recently that 3d has hit the same \"renaissance\" that 2d experienced on the SNES... Games like Ys: The Ark of Nepishtim, Persona 3, Katamari Damacy and Dragon Quest VIII all capture (in my opinion) the simple-as-you-want gameplay that the 2d games housed, but with enough artistic direction that their 3d-ness was unobtrusive.<br /><br />I think all three of the systems listed in the poll are \"too young\" to have made any impact on gaming in its present form, and to be honest the focus as of late seems to be on CONTROL and STORYTELLING a lot more than ~gameplay~ and artistic direction.  <br /><br />...Ultimately, I blame the advent of \"unskippable plot sequences\" on Super Mario World, for taking a profoundly important platform game, and making plot interruptions acceptable.  *shakes his bitter fist at Mario*<br /><br /><img src=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif?ttinline=true\"/>  I'm glad I grew up ~after~ the Atari business...

The number of \"bits\" cited in console names referred to the CPU word size and had been used by hardware marketers as a \"show of power\"; however, there was little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 or 64 bits - performance depended on more varied factors, such as processor clock speed, bandwidth, and memory size.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />EDIT: Aannnd... [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_%28sixth_generation%29#Number_of_bits_and_system_power]link.[/url]<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]The PlayStation 2's CPU (known as the 128-bit Emotion Engine) has a 64-bit double-precision core based on MIPS architecture.<br />...<br />The Sega Dreamcast has a 64-bit double-precision superscalar SuperH-4 RISC MPU core with a 32-bit integer unit using 16-bit fixed-length instructions, a 64-bit data bus allowing a variable width of either 8, 16, 32 or 64-bits, and a 128-bit floating point unit.<br />...<br />The importance of the number of bits in the modern console gaming market has thus decreased due to the use of components that process data in varying word sizes. Previously, console manufacturers advertised the n-bit talk to over-emphasize the hardware capabilities of their system. The Sega Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2 were the last systems to use the term 128-bit in their marketing to describe their capability.[hr][/quote]-Genius314"

My computer from 1999 has that much!<br /><br />Whatever... I don't understand consoles, nor care about them. I only know that my 360 has the same games that the PC does... more or less (Only without a keyboard or mouse DAMNIT!) and costs less than a new computer would. Consoles, for me, are only a temporary hold over until I GET a few thousand together to buy a new PC. Which will be many years.-----------------------<br />The end of this post.

Better CPUs are also more expensive, and if having two less powerful CPUs means lowering the console price, that's only better.<br /><br />About the 64 bit on PC thing.... Weren't the old Amiga consoles 32 bit long before the PC/Windows became 32 bit?____________<br />Don't see me as an ordinary man.<br />Even though I am an ordinary man.<br /><br />Ah, [url=http://DaVince.sitesled.com/]site.[/url]<br />Oh, and [url=http://www.tengusoft.net/]Team[/url]."

The only reason they've taken so long to appear in desktop PCs is because until recently nobody needed them.  If you recall when they were first introduced people were saying how little difference they made because there were no programs available to take advantage of the 64-bit features.  Slowly but surely people are finding that [url=http://www.dansdata.com/askdan00015.htm]3GB RAM[/url] isn't enough and they want more, or they want to spend less time encoding video to put on their iPod, and so 64-bit CPUs start to become useful and appear in desktop PCs.<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"
