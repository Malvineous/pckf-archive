The longer you let your cells decay, the sooner you are allowing yourself to die.  Smoking, drinking, getting sick, stress, unexpressed anger, and other such things just make you die sooner.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyways, by all technical definitions, you are commiting suicide by breathing --if we are to define suicide is causing an event that will eventually lead to death.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."
