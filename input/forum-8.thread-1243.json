This is officially the last post I'm writing in response to anything on this matter: take a look at all the projects that are in the works--including the ones that allow us easy editing of practically <i>every single Keen game</i>, the fast approaching first ever full mod of Keen4, of which I've seen some mindblowing betas, and WIP ports of both the Vorticons and Galaxy series for Windows--and find a way to contact the 20-something MSN Keeners of which about 10 are frequently online [not much? Consider that it's grown from, uh, zero since a couple of years ago]. Then tell me Keen is dying (not that I'll respond).<br /><br />And when did we ever get \"much traffic like we used to\"? This forums always been slow apart from annoying spam topics about controversy and the death of Keen. For most of the 90s there was <i>no PCKF</i>. No mods. We just had the original games to keep the spirit alive.<br /><br />I have more pressing things to attend to as well, but that's not going to keep me from modding and coding new Keen stuff.<br /><br />That's my last word on the matter.
