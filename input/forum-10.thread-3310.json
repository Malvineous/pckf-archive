But I was surprised that it wasn't what I expected, it was actually quite good movie. It's about some Finnish, Russian and Lapp, and the war over here in 1944 has just ended (or actually will end during the movie).<br />Anyways, I suggest it to everyone who want to see beautiful Lappland landscapes.<br /><br />Here's IMDB entry;<br />[url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308476/]www.imdb.com/title/tt0308476/[/url]<b>You hear in your mind: GAAARRRRRGG!</b>"
