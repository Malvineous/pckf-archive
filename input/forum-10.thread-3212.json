Watching the movie will spoil the movie.<br /><br />Warning: The following rant contains analysis of the plot (or lack thereof!) so if you don't want what little of the plot there is to be told to you, then don't read on......<br /><br /><br />X Men 3:<br /><br />The characters are alright.<br />The acting is nothing complaintworthy.<br /><br />The script is ghastly.<br /><br />It's like an exercise in breaking all the rules of storytelling, but NOT for any effective reason. Rulebreaking can be useful for unexpected twists, but in this movie, it just made interesting things FAIL TO HAPPEN.<br /><br />The main story lines:<br />1) The Cure for mutantness.<br />2) The Phoenix.<br />3) Rogue wants to be normal.<br />4) The Angel Dude.<br />5) Magneto's army of doom<br /><br />Well now, looky-here. We've got a mutant who can destroy the world (Phoenix), and a medical procedure that can cure mutantness.<br />OH BUT IT WOULD BE TOO PREPDICTABLE TO HAVE THOSE TWO STORYLINES COMBINE TO RESOLVE, WOULDN'T IT.<br />So what happens instead?<br />Rogue getds cured, the Phoenix gets killed, and the cure gets fought over.<br />And something happens with the Angel in a separate storyline that never combined with even Magneto's story.<br /><br />What happened at the climax of the story? There were a bunch of parallel storylines all \"Happening\" in the same place, but they never combined, and never resolved. Except that a few mutants got \"cured\", but that's not resolution. That's just writing them out of the story. Deus ex f*cking machina.<br /><br />What about the previouslyh established fact  that Rogue can drain other mutants' powers?<br />Couldn't she have used that, combined with Wolverine's healing power, to approach the Phoenix and drain a bit of hers instead of having Wolvie gut her and cry like a pussy (animal-related pun intended)? That would be combining three storylines that were just aching to combine and resolve.<br />But no.<br />Nothing happens.<br />Each storyline just bites its own tail and ends.<br /><br />Also, Rogue goes and becomes \"normal\" so that her boyfriend won't dump her.<br />And what happens when she returns?<br />Does she find him in the arms of another girl, thereby giving the audience an important lesson about what can happen if you try to change yourself just to make your lover happy when the only reason that he wasn't  happy in the first place  was because you had some powerful gift that he didn't understand?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Everything went like clockwork and they all lived predictably and uninterestingly (not to mention independently of the rest of the storyline)  ever after. <br /><br />BORRRRIIIING.<br /><br /><br />Oh and then at the very end, it turned out that the Cure didn't work after all, which undermines the whole premise of the movie, thereby making it a waste of your time to watch. Thanks, Hollywood!<br /><br /><br />Seeing \"Frasier\" as Beast was great though. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  <br /><br />P.S. My scathing review has nothing to do with the fact that THEY KILLED THE PROFESSOR!!!

The only person who's guaranteed to be dead/power-less is Jean/Phoenix. So, unfortunately, there could still be more sequels [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br /><br />Not that I had a problem with this movie, but as someone above said, if the cure didn't work then this whole movie was kind of pointless. So please, no more sequels. Spinoffs are more than welcome however [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

I think Magneto, concentrating really hard to move something, so I paid close attention to the object of his attention, but it didn't move, so... it didn't wear off.<br />Maybe I was looking at the wrong object, or maybe I blinked at the exact wrong time or something, or is it another scene altogether showing the off-weariness?Retodon8<br />Sheep happens!
