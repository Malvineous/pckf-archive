No matter how many times I tried after that, I could never find that river since.[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Just remember that this is the year of the elite devil.<br /><br />1337 + 666 = 2003[hr][/quote][img]http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3852/sheepsmall0sf.jpg[/img] <br />[url=http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/blacksheep/trailer/]trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/blacksheep/trailer/[/url]"

		"content": "In supernova I got into the space ship but when I tried to fly it... I think I got killed. No directions on how to input coordinates.<br /><br />Also I took the toilet seat off and threw it... then it disappeared... I think it was the toilet seat. I tried walking in every direction as far a I could. (I took food and water. Water I carried in mugs I got from the bar and filled them in the sink. The food I got from the space ship I believe...) I think going south got me to a fence I couldn't climb for some reason. (Soon died after.) West I ran into a bunch of bandits who took everything I had. (Soon died after.) And east I think I just flat out died. (This is all from the bar that you start at.)<br /><br />I got mad and never played that game again. It had a lot of flaws, was almost unplayable, was to easy to die in and just wasn't all that fun.<br /><br />I don't think I ever got the Titanic game to even run.-----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."
