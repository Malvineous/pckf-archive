Crichton is just taking a snipe at one of his critics. He's a jackass and a pompous man-child for doing that, but the way he's so blunt about it is hilarious.<br /><br />So basically, the comment about having a small penis made me giggle.[center]<font color=\"MAROON\">TOUGH GUYS DON'T FOLLOW FADS</font>[/center]"
