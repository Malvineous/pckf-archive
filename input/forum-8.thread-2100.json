It was a great party, and saw a surprising quantity and quality of releases. I strongly recommend checking them out. I contributed the one named Simple Life, under my Jimage alias. Watch that one too.<br /><br />There were a bunch of oldschool prods as well (C64, Amiga, Vic20), but they don't seem to be added yet. If you have access to some emulators (or even the original hardware, though I don't know how many people on this forum would have the means for PC-Commodore data transfer), give them a whirl as well when they appear.<br /><br />[url=http://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=1350&when=2007]See the demos here[/url]<br /><br />[url=http://www.syntaxparty.org/]Syntax Demo Party Website[/url]"
