		"content": "Coincidentally I released a bug in Keen Dreams today. Maybe it is already known, but I didn't find it in the KeenWiki.<br /><br />I was in level 5 (Parsnip Pass) tried to avoid a Squash, but he hit Keen while he was jumping, and this time Keen was at the right border of the level. And what happens? Keen died, but then the message that Keen had finished the level appeared. The level was really finished on the world map, and Keen even hadn't lost a life!<br /><br />[img]http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/1308/keendreamsbug1rs7.gif[/img]<br /><br />Does this also work in other levels in not so abstract situations? Yes:<br /><br />[img]http://img158.imageshack.us/img158/5720/keendreamsbug2fs2.gif[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://img486.imageshack.us/img486/8256/keendreamsbug3ka9.gif[/img]<br /><br />That means that Keen can always finish the level like this when he can be killed be an enemy at the right border of a level.<br /><br />---<br />[url=http://www.deine-stimme-gegen-armut.de][img]http://img50.imageshack.us/img50/5547/wwwdeinestimmegegenarmutde5ta.gif[/img][/url]<br />[url=http://www.deine-stimme-gegen-armut.de]www.deine-stimme-gegen-armut.de[/url]<br />(EVERY 3 SECONDS A CHILD DIES AT THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXTREMLY POVERTY)<br />(your-vote-against-poverty)"

Well, anyways, the bug can be exploited whenever there are no obstructions on a right-hand side wall (regardless if the exit is on that side or not).

Of course, if you do this in a level that contains a Gnosticene, you won't rescue him unless you use the warp cheat later and rescue him normally.<br /><br />I didn't try this in KDreams anyway.------------------<br /><b>SM:</b> <i>\"I could go and write a page about the Theory of Relativity (or whatever it's called), but, what is the point if I don't know what the Theory of Relativity is?\"</i><br /><br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]"
