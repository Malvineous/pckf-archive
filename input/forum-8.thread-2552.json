Some links in the archives will take you to the present board for some reason and some links won't have any page to load at all, but there's quite a few archived pages there.--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"

		"content": "The reason that the links take you to the present board is that the threads have not been archived, so the Wayback Machine fetches the latest page from the original website - this is why there are a lot of \"topic not found\" errors. I saved the Harry Potter thread in its entirety before the attack for some reason, so I can add that to the \"pile\" if you want.<br /><br />Actually, what you've found is rather interesting: I had no idea you could access this board via pub7. (I only knew of b7, pub128 and p072, which has the least posts of all)<br /><br />EDIT: Upon inspection, almost none of the threads and few of the forum pages are actually intact. Additionally, pub7 redirects to p072 - so it isn't actually anything new.[url=http://last.fm/users/grafix5000/][img]http://toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobbler.png[/img][/url]<br />[url=http://toxicsheep.com]toxicsheep.com[/url] | [url=http://commanderkeen.org]coming up next...[/url]"
