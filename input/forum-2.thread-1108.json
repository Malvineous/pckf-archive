I still tinker with Worminator on and off, and the game has undergone many improvements over the years.<br /><br />If you are interested, I can provide you with code from one of the more recent builds, though it is largely the same structurally.  Honestly though, I'd do things totally different if I were making another sidescroller today, so don't be fooled into thinking that Isis II or Worminator is a really good example of how to code a sidescroller.  None the less, it should be easy to understand at least the basic flow of the game."

		"content": "Hmm well honestly, I didn't really find any useful articles or books about game programming when I started fooling around with this stuff.  I had some experience making simple games with QBasic in the past, but that was about it.<br /><br />Worminator actually started off as just a tile map editor, I was originally going to make it edit keen 1-3 levels.  Then I just fooled around with making a little stick man walk around the levels instead (no slopes, no other sprites, no animations at this point).  It turned out to be pretty easy, just had to check a few tiles every time you moved to see if they were solid or not.<br /><br />After that I just slowly hacked more and more into the game over the next year or so.  I just learned everything by trial and error (even though the game contains a good many errors still!).<br /><br />The basic approach is really simple.  You have 4 tile grids, a background graphics layer, a foreground graphics layer, an info tile layer, and a graphic properties layer.  Background/foreground layers just have pointers to graphical tiles, the info layer contains info about what the tile is (a slope, a wall, a breakable tile, empty space, etc...) and the graphical properties layer is used for special masking effects (like making the foreground translucent).<br /><br />For sprites, I just made a fixed size array of sprite structures, which look something like this:<br /><br />typedef struct SPRITE {<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp int sprite_active;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp int sprite_type;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp char in_range;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp int timer;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp char animation_state;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp int width, height;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp int action_state;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp int frame;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp float hit_points_left;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp float x_position_in_pixels, y_position_in_pixels;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp float x_acceleration, y_acceleration;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp char direction;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp unsigned char rotate_factor;<br />&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp } SPRITE;<br /><br />Then I made a bunch of functions to spawn sprites, move sprites, etc...  Each of these functions would take an index number that references a sprite in the array.  There were also separate AI functions for every type of sprite.  Then every frame I just loop through the sprite array and call the appropriate AI routine for every sprite, and pass it its index within the array.<br /><br />Its all really basic honestly.  I'll zip up the latest worminator code for you later if you like.  You need MSVC 6.0+ and winallegro to run it though."

I just didn't have the time to work on the game that much anymore so I had to bail.  If you remember, the original idea I had for the game was basically a worminator clone with Keen graphics, so I never planned on having it grow so much.<br /><br />I think there were at least 3-4 full tilesets done, most if not all of the weapons, and a good number of enemies.

It's a shame, because he was really looking forward to the potential of Keen4-6 modding... which became a reality less than a year after he left.  <img src=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />Man, seeing that Oueff stuff brings back memories.  I was only on that style board for maybe a month, before the switch.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>"

Gee, what am I thinking; do you have any friends? Is what I said close to the truth? Looks like it, either that or it comes close; noone can be as much of an idiot as you pretend to be.
