		"content": "Interesting question. I'm not really sure how to answer it, actually.<br /><br />It's kind of challenging to discern what I've experienced that suggest there's something more from what I've come to believe as a matter of faith, and then whether I believe what I do because I necessarily want to...<br /><br />God to me would be a unity of all existence, not something apart from us but something of which we are a part, as it were. It/he/she/they would not be a disembodied consciousness or some bearded fellow sitting on a cloud with a harp and lightning bolt, but the very universe itself, and whatever exists and doesn't exist beyond it, including us.<br /><br />I don't think it's a matter of <i>wanting</i> to believe. Though there are many things that fall into this category, my belief in 'God' stems not from a need to justify my existence (an explanation that modern psychology seems to obsess over) but from the fact it makes sense in the context of my experiences blended with those of others that fall within my believability gauge, which is again fueled by previous experience.<br /><br />On one level, I suppose I do want there to be a supreme being, and ultimate purpose to life, since that would mean we'll actually find an answer someday (and then probably decide to forget it again and play the game again). Then we may find a way to directly and collectively communicate with this higher nature and will find that all our religions stem from a common source and we'll have that much less to fight about.<br /><br />If there is no god, we're doomed forever to argue about it (well, not so really forever, but at least for as long as we last).<br /><br />However, the idea of existence looping endlessly seems somewhat depressing to me. What's the purpose in it if we're just going to end it and start afresh? I wanna keep playing! But then that's how life works, and that's how any endeavour or entertainment medium functions, is it not? So it shouldn't really seem as dismal as it does, should it? *shrugs*<br /><br />We need a baseline for this poll before I vote, though, as LevelLord says.

I won't even try to think about it anymore, it is too complex.<br /><br />It's impossible to think how this all was created, or how on Earth it all could have always been, or anything. Especially its purpose. But one thing that's sure; whatever it is, it just is, and that's what matters. The fact there even is such a thing as existence makes it have something purpose, to me.<br /><br />This is deeply meta-everything, and there's actually no reason to think about these things. One can live happily without thinking about them. Or if you do think, don't think too much, it does the same for brains than a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.

Why there was temptation?<br />God has this master plan, which is unknown. It's also paradoxical, and mostly doesn't make any sense to us at all. (For example, God has kinda planned anything, but we have free will. That can't be understood.) I don't believe reality is deterministic, no. There are just some things that happen the way God wants. The paradise wasn't heaven, it was just the starting place of the history. It was good, but not perfect heaven.<br />Why all this? It's something perfect plan that we can't even understand.<br /><br />Anyways, I most probably lost the track of thoughts and didn't write what I was intending, sorry. These things simply can't be known and there's no point thinking them that deeply.<br />We just need to realize God is the ultimate good. If you love the idea of ultimate beauty, goodness, and such, you do want to be near it and praise it free-willingly.<br />And to add; I still don't think heaven is only that kind of praising. Even if it is, that's good for me. Remember that you are not the entirely same person in heaven.

It's also paradoxical, and mostly doesn't make any sense to us at all. (For example, God has kinda planned anything, but we have free will. That can't be understood.) I don't believe reality is deterministic, no. There are just some things that happen the way God wants. The paradise wasn't heaven, it was just the starting place of the history. It was good, but not perfect heaven.<br />Why all this? It's something perfect plan that we can't even understand.[hr][/quote]<br />There was evil in the paradise because Satan was there, there won't be evil in heaven because Satan won't be there - from bibical point of view. <br />According to the bible, yes God has a plan with what will happen in the future but this was not until the fall of Adam and Eve. Remember in the bible is clearly stated that God hate sins and there weren't any in the paradise. If God willingly let Adam and Eve sin then he would be a liar because he would be the one who let evil come into the world, it could have been prevented because he should be mightier then the devil.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]We just need to realize God is the ultimate good. If you love the idea of ultimate beauty, goodness, and such, you do want to be near it and praise it free-willingly.[hr][/quote]<br />I think God has only set the standard for what is good and bad. I might have a different one. <br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Remember that you are not the entirely same person in heaven. You don't think negatively anymore, you realize answer to the question \"Why?\", there simply is not nor will be sorrow or anything depressing.

Where will they go if the population crashes? Will everyone thus suffer an infinite amount? How does the process occur?<br />[hr]This is assuming the afterlife adheres to a linear system of time. It's (almost) impossible for us to imagine anything beyond it, but ultimately there is no difference between past, present and future. Thus, any spirit can select any moment in time to incarnate. In addition, there is no limit to the amount of instances the original consciousness can split itself into, and thus as many spirits as may be necessary at any one point in time can exist at once.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Djaser</b> No life is fun because there are things you are looking foreward to, goals to reach. That's all over in heaven, you'll have everything you need there.<br />[hr]Not really. Ever heard of 'just being' and/or 'going with the flow'? It's really quite enjoyable, and makes things fall into place much easier.<br /><br />I understand what you're saying, though. Life wouldn't be what it is without challenges. If everything was easy, and worked out for the best no matter what we chose to do, what would be the point of it all? The problem is, our general idea of 'challenging' involves fighting against our own self to get things 'done', trying to get past our habits, our emotions, our inhibitions.<br /><br />This is the equivalent of banging your head against a wall that stands in our way, rather than finding a way around it in order to get on with our journey. There are far more interesting challenges out there.<br /><br />[hr]<b>najawa</b> You make this really cool game... and you need beta testers. You release some of the code to some teens. Some sell the code, and betray you, but others don't. The ones that don't, you give them the full code.<br /><br />Analogy explained; God sends us to earth with just a vauge partial example of heaven (earth). We either sqander our time here, or we are good stewards. The good stewards are rewarded.<br />[hr]Or perhaps more to the effect of this: we're all here to simply experience the world/game that we, as God, created/create/are creating. There is no higher or lower purpose than that. The good and the bad are necessary, as 'good' cannot be experienced as such unless there's something with which to compare it (this also means that nothing must somehow exist, which seems entirely against its definition, but that's an entirely different mindtrip again).<br /><br />Hell is simply the process, either herenow or in the layers of reality above, around, within, where/what/how/ifever they are, of not being conscious of what we are creating in our lives. While we have complete freedom to manifest whatever we wish (which we have for the most part forgotten, out of necessity as part of the aforementioned dichotomy--knowing [gnosis] cannot exist without first notknowing [agnosis]) Godself will keep reminding usself of the lessons we have chosen to learn, the same circumstances will keep remanifesting, as long as we refuse to re-member--accept them back into ourselves.<br /><br />Heaven is the complement of that process:<br />[hr]<b>T.S. Eliot</b>We shall not cease from exploration.

It matters not whether God exists or not, in whatever form. If my beliefs are correct, then if I believed differently it wouldn't matter (though with different beleifs I wouldn't believe that). The inner, outer and non-worlds are interreflections of each other, so God (n)either exists or unexists throughout/throughin all of it. In the end, which is also the beginning, and yet neither, God/us/not will be God/us/not.<br /><br />What I <i>want</i> is to live in the flow, to create the things I long to create/manifest without self-imposed obstacles blocking my path.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"

This gets too difficult for my mind. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dead.gif[/img]   These things can't be thought at all..<br /><br />Don't you others find it difficult for example to think how the reality became real?

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-crazy.gif[/img]  <br />I've thought about these things way too many hours, and don't want to do that much anymore. I seriously started to think about these probably at the age of 12. Perhaps earlier.<br /><br /><br />Edit: Trippin' post once again Spleen. You're right, words and terms we have in our minds can't describe many things at all.<br />Agree with you on the goals and targets; definitive goals and targets aren't required. Existence can be enjoyable by just going with the flow, as you said.<br /><br />\"(this also means that nothing must somehow exist, which seems entirely against its definition, but that's an entirely different mindtrip again)\"<br />Yeah, that's rather trippy.

Personally I want to do things I want to do, what I find right, interesting, fun, enjoyable, and similarly live in the flow, although in that I haven't succeeded yet so well. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />Thanks for the post again Spleen, it helped me to broaden my view. I just made this quote up, dunno if someone else has said it before me (probably not because it sucks and isn't well-formed);<br />\"Life's stage is simple, but the backstage is too complex. But luckily we don't need to care about the backstage since we're on stage.\"<br /><br />With stage I meant the life, the death, the existence, the nonexistence, and with backstage a lot more complex thing; how all of those work, time, space, how consciusness works etc..<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"

So the question is... are you normal?<br /><br /><br />Now; I moot few new points:<br /><br />1.) Sex is male orientated; most pornography is directed toward men; in some cases women have been hired to enter chatrooms and reassure the men therein to keep them interested and chatting. In modern society it is men who are percieved as desiring sex the most and being most susceptible to manipulation by those using sex to make them buy things. Even our language is orientated toward men; men 'bonk', screw and etc women, assigning the women passive roles.<br /><br />2.) Homosexualtiy and transexuality are more prevalent in men, is this because it is sex and sex drive based rather than based in more remote areas of the mind such as relationships and gender identity? Or are less women gay because they have less sexual drive and thus do not 'feel' as strongly their sexual orientation?<br /><br />3.) In many species males are dominant, both physically and aggressively; is this because their natural role is to compete for females and impregnate as many as possible whilst females must make the physical sacrifices to become pregnant and raise young? If so, how does this impact our society?<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/lind.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
