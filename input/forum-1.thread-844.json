While unable to move as its rooted in the ground this plant is covered with a number of sharp 'leaves' that look rather like fins and can flex to cut any attacking herbivore. The eyes help the plant see potential attackers.<br /><br />Howver the name 'Animal-Plant-Hybrid' never caught on.A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
