It uses the original keen engine so u can do all that stuff, including poles, ledge grabbing, pogo, (no moving or drop down platforms yet). I got it working last night after like 6 hours of program time from scratch. (yay!) And I can't find any bugs (YAY!)<br />   I can take suggestions. RIght now its gonna be you just set the amount of hits to win, start amount of ammo, the recharge time and recharge amount (such as 2 per 5 seconds, or x per y seconds), the level, and the music (original keen music).<br />   It's not online, sorry.

This was easier and made more sense to me, cuz if u shoot up/down on a pole, the blast will be on either the left side or right side, so seeing which side you;re on when moving down is important.<br />   (2). There are no moving platforms or ledges that you can drop down from by pressing DOWN + CTRL<br />   (you can now pogo high from the ground, which is the only way to do the impossible pogo trick)<br />   (3). The jump and pogo heights are probably a little different.<br />   (4). The run and pole climb/descend speeds are probably a bit different.<br />   (5). You always accelerate in free fall. I may change this.<br /><br />   The only bug i have found is the following:<br />   When hitting a corner of the block exactly the right way you will instantly appear either at the top of the next block above or the bottom, depending on if you're moving up or down. This used to be instantly appearing at block highest up from where you were or fartherst down.<br />   I rather liked that bug however; it adds interesting gameplay and I called it the impossible grappling hook trick.- .... . &lt;&gt; ..- -. .. ...- . .-. ... . &lt;&gt; .. ... &lt;&gt; - --- .- ... -"

Windows only), and excessive resource requirements (simple platformers should be able to run on an old Pentium, at the most extreme).<br /><br />Some of these issues may be unfounded, but it's just the general impression I get. It doesn't bother me that much, though. If the result is good I'm all for it. I just prefer to play and create games that are more flexible, cross-platform and compact."

A DirectX 8 compatible graphics card with at least 16MB of memory is required for most created games. It requires a screen resolution of at least 800x600 and 65000 (16-bit) colors. Also a DirectX 8 compatible sound card is required. It requires DirectX version 8.0 or later to be installed on your computer. (You can download the newest version of DirectX from the Microsoft website at: [url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/.)]www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/.)[/url] When designing and testing games, the memory requirements are pretty high (at least 64 MB and preferably more, also depending on the operating system). When just running games, the memory requirements are less severe and depend a lot on the type of game. \"<br /><br />All of that is not bad for these days, but point taken about only running on windows. Still, GM pwns; maybe one day I won't believe it anymore since I don't know any other real language, but I know I've mastered GML (minus internet and particles) and I know what I can do with it and it's alot. [EDIT: O and how could I 4get; ITS FREE ($20 registered, which is useful, but you can do quite alot without it).<br />The resources are excessive because GM is designed to be able to make any kind of game, and thus has to be broad. If you wanted to make one specific kind of game, then you could write the engine to be the least resource-requiring, get what i mean.<br /><br />Alex, I got no clue what you mean by GMC; I'm not on any Game Maker forums unless I forgot lol. Oh and there's plenty games made in GM worth playing<br />[url=http://www.gamemakergames.com/]www.gamemakergames.com/[/url]<br />I highly recommend games by PugFugly; stupid name, but he pwnz; his games are very arcade style of the old days<br /><br />GM can do 3d u know, and I know how to do that too. I try to think of cool, original 3d style games for Keen. I believe that TUIT should be a new way of 3d games, just like KEEN1 had the new side-scrollling trick never before seen.TUIT should have a unique, orignal engine too.

It seems logical that colour blending would require more power, but just how much more would probably require some experimentation. Maybe someone more familiar with how Game Maker does those things might be of more help.<br /><br />That said, there are two other factors you'd do well to consider:<br />1) RAM - if the tileset becomes a lot larger, you're going to be using up more memory. You'll need to keep that balance in mind.<br />2) Flexibility - if you make versatiles [pun blatantly intentional] you have a lot more freedom in theming your levels.<br /><br />I say try both and find a way of benchmarking the outcomes."

If you released it to the Keen community everyone would know it was originally your work, and the thief wouldn't get any credit.<br /><br />I think the potential benefit (making people happy by providing them with something entertaining) far outweighs any potential negatives.  As a programmer brought up on DOS/Windows, I used to think this way - I was paranoid that if I released my programs people would try to steal them, but once I moved over to the Linux world where *everyone* releases their programs, source code and all, completely for free, suddenly I realised that I was worrying over nothing.<br /><br />Once you can let go of the paranoia, after your first couple of full releases you'll wonder what you used to worry about [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

Trust me, if I'm spending the time to do the stuff I'm doing, then you should spend the time to make a good video game and giving it to the Keen peoples of the world.<br /><br />Hell, it may not be a superior noble goal, but it is still a goal.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

There are plenty of people who give this no real thought and do nothing about it. That won't be me. I will give money to orgs for this and serve in them. I can't change everything, but I can help some people who are truly in need of it instead of just living for myself.<br /><br />When you say where would the world be without entertainment, u are shooting yourself in that foot man. That's like saying, okay the world is bad but u shouldnt worry; and there should be entertainment or the world will be bad.<br /><br />I dont have anything against entertainment, but i do have something against wasting your life on it and/or putting things in entertaiment that are a bad influence (not keen lol).<br /><br />\"So what would happen if your work was \"stolen\"?\" -Malvineous<br /><br />I am running, or will run, all the scenarios through my head.
