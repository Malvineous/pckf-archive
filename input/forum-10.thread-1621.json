I had to witness one of the most boring and uninspiring performance of a hardrock group of all time. Fortunately this group didn't win, no we are sending the Dutch mega pop group Treble with [url=http://www.treble.nl/treble/multimedia/video/ramaganana_2003]this song![/url]<br />[img]http://www.treble.nl/design/treble/images/main.19.jpg[/img]Don't be afraid lads take a closer look, aren't they pretty?<br /><br />Thus now that I had lost my last believe in humanity I wanted to commit suicide but no not all was in vain: Today I read that Finland will let heavy metal group Lordi slaughter the audience of the Eurovision contest while playing [url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=3YgOHggUjhk&search=lordi]this song![/url]<br />[img]http://www.headbanger.hu/be/htdocs/updir/lordi.jpg[/img]<br />Don't judge them on their look, they can't help it, they where born this way.<br />So for the first time ever I'm very curious who's going to win. I'll vote for Lordi.<br /><br />[img]http://www.rockidols.ru/up/upload/52-lordi-120703-28.jpg[/img]<br />Hell yeah! -----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamba.nl/storage/view/335/0/sn/Snow_Ball.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.com/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img]<br />Jamster! rules!"

The song isn't bad at all, I think. I just heard it the first time. Finland has never won or got very high in the Eurovision chart, I hope this year brings some better results. At least this is quite different from Finland's usual contestants..<br /><br />But then again, it may be that the public doesn't understand our choice at all and we get the worst votes ever, and Treble wins.
