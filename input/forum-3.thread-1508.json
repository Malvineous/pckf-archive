So my idea is, get all us loyal keen fans together to create Punctuation and Numerals for the SGA.<br /><br />The punctuation marks that are used most (I think) are:<br />Commas ,<br />Apostrophes '<br />Quotes \"<br />Parentheses ()<br />Colons :<br />Question Marks ?<br />Exclamation Points !<br />Periods . -Already have a period<br /><br />Others include slashes // at signs @ etc.<br /><br />We also need Numerals, 0-9 to start and we can add more for 10-up later. Since Tom Hall created the SGA by modifying the Latin alphabet, I'm thinking maybe we could do the same for numerals, but that's up to the individual.<br /><br />So who is with me?"

		"content": "It's not like binary, it's more like Roman numerals. It's a bijective numeral system using the digit set {1, 314}, represented by the comma and period. That means that numbers are represented as a string of digits which are summed to find the number it represents. True base 314 would require 314 digits, and base 1 would require one. A unary positional system is impossible though, since you need something to represent empty positions.<br /><br />EDIT: No, I don't think it's bijective after all. As I understand it, those are positional. This is more of a tally system.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/toughyorp.png[/img]"
