		"content": "Even with the single last level you need to play to get the end sequence, I'd consider it the hardest.  The Mangling Machine is a more difficult level than any other Keen level in the official games.  Meeps which are effectively impossible for you to shoot, but who can shoot back at you?  Timed moves under giant squishing limbs?  Lasers falling down from the ceiling and distracting you?  <br /><br />It's a tough level--and you don't get any save-load to help you out...  not to mention the DOO DOO DOOOOOOOOOOO DOO every time you enter the level.  :-)<br /><br />But yes, combine that single level with countless others which were either not playtested at all, or possibly designed to be played with God mode on... and it's the hardest legit episode of Keen, in my mind."
