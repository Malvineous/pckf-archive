Pressure can sometimes serve this purpose, forcing me to set boundaries in order to get it done on time. However, for the most part it just stresses me out and I either do a poor job or put up some sort of rebellion.<br /><br />I've more recently started working at complicated projects little bits at a time, instead of pushing full steam ahead on the same project ten times a year with a short (and inevitably unmet) deadline.<br /><br />Also, I spend a lot more time planning things before doing the work. otherwise I end up with things that almost meet the basic requirements but cannot be completed or expanded upon without a complete overhaul due to lots of little things I've overlooked along the way."
