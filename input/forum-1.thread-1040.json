The registered version's title screen is distinctly different. The story, not so much, but does mention a possible Keen Dreams sequel - Keen meets the meats. Or perhaps Dosgames.com has the registered version up for download...

		"content": "Well, the dosgames.com version doesn't mention Keen Meats the Meats, or have a distinctive title screen, and neither does the version I bought from Softdisk.  The only thing different is that if you type start at the command prompt it gives you a selection of whether you want to play or read some manuals.  Although it does have a nice single exe installer, which is a plus, but if I had know there was no other changes, I wouldn't have bought it for $10.  Maybe for $5, though.-Mingy Jongo: Crafty Shaman Impersonator"
