		"content": "The FOX network has guaranteed that Homer, Marge and the rest of the Simpson clan won't be leaving Evergreen Terrace any time soon, greenlighting two more seasons of the long-running animated series.<br />  <br />The decision to produce two more seasons means that The Simpsons will remain on air until at least 2008, passing the 400 episode mark in May, 2007.<br /><br />The 17th season of The Simpsons is currently on the air. With two more seasons under its belt by 2008, the show will be very close to becoming the longest running TV series of all time. Gunsmoke, at 20 seasons, currently holds the record.<br /><br />Dan Castellaneta, Nancy Cartwright, Hank Azaria and the other principal members of the voice cast are expected to stay on for the upcoming seasons.<br /><br />Last year, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening revealed his goal was to produce 366 episodes - \"one for every day of the year, including leap years\". Perhaps his new aim is to produce enough episodes to allow viewers to watch a different one each day for two years.
