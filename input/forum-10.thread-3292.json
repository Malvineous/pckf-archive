Only time will tell, but from watching this original preview, the whole thing looks like it's trying to be a B-quality movie from the get-go."

I mean, they were fun games, but they were kind of funny at times.  And some of the Doom II music sounded like carnival songs.*** ---   I Am Keen is hell bent for leather.  Are you?   --- ***"
