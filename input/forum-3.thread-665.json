Probably the reason why DOSbox hasn't been ported to PSP i guess. Sad thing when you think about all the great old PC games out there.<br /><br />It would be kickass to play Keen on PSP though i guess everyone agrees on that point [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-foot.gif[/img]"
