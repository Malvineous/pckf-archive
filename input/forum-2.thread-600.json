This would explain why there are far more mods for the early Keens, but having never tried modding myself, I was just wondering what people are finding the most difficult hurdle to get past when trying to make a Keen4 mod?"

I've finally got to the point where the architecture is complete enough to begin the real programming.  The idea is that you'll only have to write code to read/write a specific file format (such as a Keen4 map, an IMF file, a Duke3D GRP file, or whatever) and the editing system will take care of the user interface.  That way you only have to write a \"2D map editor\" once, and it'll work with everything from Xargon to Wolf3D."
