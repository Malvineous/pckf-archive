It's a shame they're removing all traces of the church and religion from the film adaption, since that was what the whole underlying message was about - unless you're like the director, who seems to think that \"it's still basically the story of a little girl who's looking for her true mother and father - it's just an emotional story at heart\".

		"content": "Personally I'm torn between liking the books overall, and hating its presentation of religion - especially as these are books aimed at young people (whether by the author's intention or the publisher's misestimating of an appropriate target audience), and I think it's bad to give such a negative view of any religion to young people who may not have made up their own minds about it in the real world yet. (Possibly it's just because I'm Christian and it's my religion that's being attacked, but I *think* I'd still feel strongly about it if it was any other religion. The last thing our world needs is encouraging religous intolerance.)<br /><br />Religious misgivings aside, I do like most other things about the books - good characters, an interesting plot, great writing; I really like the idea of daemons, too. But the religion issue is very important to me, and puts me off recommending them.<br /><br />Fans of the books should definitely check out the audiobook version, by the way - they're more like radio dramas, with each character played by a different actor, and Philip Pullman as narrator.[hr]<br /><br />RocketJess, blasting off again!<br /><br />[url=http://www.geocities.com/rocketjess]RocketJes's Secret Base[/url]"
