The last one I actually remember was... I don't know when. Long before I found the PCKF, I'm pretty certain. There was a lot of underground stuff, and on the surface there were igloos. When I later played RKP3, it reminded me a lot of that dream.<br /><br />[img]http://files.commanderkeen.org/users/jimage/images/keenigloodream.PNG[/img]<br /><br />[hr]<b>Q90</b> maybe a sign that you're crazy<br />[hr]Also, of course he's crazy.
