Thanks.<br /><br /><b><br />A Tutorial on how to be as good as 'Alex' - By Alex.</b><br /><br /><b>Step 1:</b> No matter how hard it may be, collect ALL the lives and avoid loosing them by touching the spikes! Lives MULTIPLY YOUR SCORE! (e.g. 1 life will double your total score, 2 will tripple etc.)<br /><br /><b>Step 2:</b> Get all 4 gems! doing this will get you 50,000 pts! However, if you miss one, then don't bother wasting your time and focus on somthing else. Less than 4 gems = 0 points!<br /><br /><b>Step 3:</b> Get as many points as you possible can. Especially Icecreams. If there are no icecreams go for the doughnut. If theres no doughnuts go for the gumball, ignore the rest.<br /><br /><b>Step 4:</b> What ever you do, do NOT let the birds touch you! You have a Bonus Score which counts up in the top right. If you touch a bird your bonus will be lowered (ALOT), also, the acceleration speed of the bonus score will be reset. Use your gun to blow those birds out the way and get the hell out of there! But beware, only use your gun if absolutely necessary, as every shot resets the acceleration of your bonus!<br /><br /><b>Step 5:</b> If you did all the following correctly you'll be looking at somthing like this:<br /><br />Points:        150,000<br />Bonus Score: 50,000<br />Gem Bonus:   50,000<br /><br />Subtotal:     250,000<br /><br />Total: (Subtotal x 3Lives) + Subtotal<br /><b>Total:      1,000,000</b><br /><br />---------<br />[img]http://img250.echo.cx/img250/9885/comicstrip9vf.gif[/img]"

(The harder downwards speed would be faster, whereas the harder side-to-side would be slower) This would have an appropriately large point multiplier, of course.[url=http://www.toxicsheep.com]www.toxicsheep.com[/url]<br />[url=http://www.last.fm/user/grafix5000/][img]http://www.toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobblersig.php[/img][/url]"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br />It automatically turns fullscreen, well, there's a lot of black around the actual game with my resolution, so fullscreen isn't the right word, but I'm talking about the big seam smack dab in the middle of course.<br /><br />Could you make a windowed mode possible, that would be the quickest way of solving this for people like me.Retodon8<br />You live, you die, you are remembered, you are forgotten.
