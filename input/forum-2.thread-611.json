Once I get the full interface working, which is not far off, it will be mostly finished in terms of content, but not neccessarily in terms of time because I plan some cutscenes for it which can take a while.<br />Anyway, I need to know from all you other modders out there - what are the copyright issues about this? I have ripped sprites from all Keen games besides KeenDreams (and none from the gameboy one of course). I really don't think I'm gonna have any music from the original Keen games so don't worry about that. Oh, and good and fitting sound effects are proving hard to find on the net for free, (I don't know of any dowloads for original Keen sounds but if there is, please let me know and tell me about the copyright issues of that.) That's all the copyright things I can think of that I need to know - graphics, music, sound, and ID owning the rights to Keen. Please tell me what I need to do to be sure to say within the law about these and any other issues.<br />Oh, and I DON'T plan to make money off this game or anything like that - I'm just gonna put it online for free like all the other mods I know.

I'll proly put it in the Title Screen and the credits. Thanx again.<br /><br />OH! and if the moderators dont mind me changing the subject, I need some sound effects for my game. I've painfully learned that finding good sound effects on the web is most difficult. If only Goodle had a sound search the way they have a image search.<br />The sounds I need are:<br />gun reloading (for neural stunner), pogo sound, (yes, I got pogo working), jump sound too I guess, and nueral stunner shooting sound.<br />The ones that K4-6 have too, I'd like them to be as close as possible to that. So if anyone knows of a good sound library out there, please let me know. And they have to be sounds legal to download and use in a free game like this.
