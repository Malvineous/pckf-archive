I've not got a plot firmly in place yet, but I'm thinking it'll be something to do with me, space pirates and maybe even Commander Keen.  We'll see.  Anyhow, I've not much done yet, the walking sprites and this neat little \"One Moment\" screen replacement.<br /><br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/tiba1.gif[/img]<br /><br />I've got plenty else to do, so don't expect this to be done in an instant, if anyone even is interested in this premise.

Their chosen craft should be old (because it is cheaper), modifiable (if it's old...), equipped with a lot of shields (we are talking about individuals, not a fleet!), a reserved engine (or hyperdrive if you like) for escaping patrols and weaponry able to disable, and if they want to, destroy ships. Their main targets are transports and unarmed convoys, because these are easy to disable and carry a lot of stuff beyond imagination. If they steal a personal craft (I think your main character has a fighter-like vehicle, not a huge cruiser, right?), that can be of 3 reasons:<br />1: the craft has something they want to use in their own ships<br />2: they have had personal problems with the owner of the craft<br />3: the craft itself is worth a lot (which in case of a personal transport I doubt) and can be sold for a lot of cash.<br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dexter.gif[/img] ------------------------------------------------------<br />Keep in mind, I'm not an artist.<br /><br />\"Take evasive action!\""

Since it seemed to be 16 color, it worked out quite well, heh heh.  But my house looks more different than the mansion than I wanted, and I kinda felt cheap ripping that directly off for this.  Even though I'm ripping so many other things off.  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br />Still, I think I may add some stars and put the burning ship back in.  As for the appearance of the ship, it's gonna be pretty simple.  Saucer shaped, a lot like the UFOs you encounter in EarthBound.  Only... you know, big enough for people to be in.<br /><br />I believe someone suggested the main character had a ship of some sort?  This is not the case.  The character is just a regular teenage kid who lives in the middle of nowhere, who falls victim to invading space pirates.<br /><br />As for what he'll be doing, well.  When he finds out that pirates from space are not only invading the countryside, but have stolen his four most precious posessions (Computer, TV, two other yet to be determined objects) he grabs himself a shotgun and sets out to get his stuff back.  And, well, to hopefully chase the space pirates off.<br /><br />Level design, well, I'll probably need a hand for tiles and mapping, though I can do some sketches of level ideas if anyone would care to help me.  I'm already starting to bubble and stew ideas in my head over this.  I just hope there are enough tiles to accomodate a rural setting AND an alien technological setting.  &gt;&lt;<br /><br />So yeah, that's about all for now."

Either make the sprite 8 pixels taller and adjust accordingly (you may have to do that for ALL frames, though)... or bend your d00d's knees a little more and move everything down a pixel, to scrunch him more.  Also, you still haven't fixed the strange alignment issues when Ian jumps facing left.<br /><br />Your Psychobilly's walk looks a little awkward--and I know it's tough to make a believable walk with just 2 frames of animation... If you want it to look like he's sorta lilting along, almost dancing, than fine--keep it like that ;-)  Otherwise, one frame where his legs are apart, and he's one pixel shorter vertically, like  / \\ would be good, and then another one where he's 1 pixel taller (due to the 'lift' in his legs) and then they're together, maybe knees bent, like $ would be good.  If you don't understand, maybe Ilsoap can explain it better, or maybe I can just toss together a tiny picture.<br /><br />Those things aside, though, this is looking good--I like your guy's hair.

I understand the Psychobilly thing perfectly; I myself even thought it looked strange, comparing it to the walk of Bagman, from the arcade game of the same name.  Seriously, if you ever happen to play it, you'll notice right away what I mean.<br /><br />As for the hair cutoff, that was a strange thing.  I first made it 8 bigger, but found that if I landed a jump, I continually fell THROUGH THE FLOOR.  So I simply lifted the legs more.  All in all, the jump is almost perfect now.  There is, however, still one problem I need to work on.<br /><br />THE JUMPING JITTERS, as I've dubbed them, ARE A TOUGH PROBLEM TO FIX.  It seems that if I move him much more towards the left, the front of his hair will end up getting cut off, and it'll look terrible.  I'm gonna fiddle with this a little more, but if I can't get it, I may release the sprites and see if somebody more experienced can't get a handle on the situation.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm thinking about level design and the like, I may start up with some tile stuff soon.  I think I'm going to turn the clam plant into a snapping bear trap.  As for enemies, the Vorticon will become a Space Pirate, the Sentry Robot a Space Pirate with a Jello Pistol, but as for the rest, I'm open for suggestions.<br /><br />Oh, and if anyone's interested, I've already started planning a sequel, curse my creativity.  It'll only ever exist if I get enough C++ programming knowledge to create my own engine, though.<br /><br />EDIT: I fixed the jumping jitters as well as I could.  I can't notice it anymore.<br /><br />Also, I'm curious as to why nobody has commented on the fact that when you shoot the Psychobilly, his HEAD EXPLODES."

The yorp and garg replacements (Mimrock and Psychobilly respectively, if you forgot) have long been finished, and the Space Pirate needs only death frames.  I'm going to look into the possibility of editing Ian's walking frames a little before moving on to finally replace the jumping frames, and then the pogo stick.<br /><br />Further ideas have come to me in the process of my continued work.  I will probably be replacing the Sentry Robots with Space Krakens* (as depicted in VBIAFHC #3), who will bob along on tentacled limbs and fire deadly rays from their eyes.  The freeze cannons will be either a variant of the current space pirates in some sort of blast armor, or Square Strongbody (VBIAFHC #5) carrying a stasis ray cannon.  Stasis rays are going to be how I explain the fact that there are free floating objects outside--the pirates left some things floating around in stasis fields while rampaging through the countryside.<br /><br />I'll do a sprite for either one (armored space pirate and Strongbody) and see which one you guys like better.<br /><br />EDIT: Here's the space pirate stasis cannon trooper, or whatever I end up calling it.<br /><br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/spacepirate_stasis.png[/img]<br /><br />Unless somebody else really wants to see a Strongbody to compare with, I'm probably going with this.<br /><br />*EDIT #2: Space Kraken.<br /><br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/spacekraken.gif[/img]<br /><br />I'm having problems, though.  Maybe it's because I've yet to replace all the sprites of the Sentry Robot with those sized for the Space Kraken.  But if it isn't, could somebody make me a quick patch that draws the Sentry Robot enemy eight pixels higher?  Otherwise, it gets caught in the ground.<br /><br />EDIT #3: I replaced all the frames.  Now it actually seems to be stuck FURTHER in the ground.  A screenshot, if that would help:<br /><br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/theproblemwithspacekrakens.png[/img]<br /><br />As for level design, I'm thinking it'll be mainly forested areas for the outside levels.  Inside levels will be the space ships, and I'm thinking that I'm going to design them mostly out of ice tiles and have them have slick, shiny metal surfaces everywhere.  The important swag that needs recovering has been settled on as my cell phone, my fedora, my TV and my computer, in that order.  I have little in mind for bonus items--so far, I've edited the suspiciously Pepsi-like soda can into a Mountain Dew can, in respect to that.  Pogo stick will probably be replaced by springs on the bottoms of shoes.<br /><br />Also, I need some advice on a level editor.  iKeen looks like it'd be nice, but it chews levels up when I try to load them.  I have the Keen1 tileset loaded, and it seems to be displaying the levels... it just shows everything as the wrong tiles.  Any idea as to why this might be?"

Anything else is likely to be too large to be usable--you should only have one or two that are 96, anyway.
