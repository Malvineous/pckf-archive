There'll be a pole there--climb down it, and head left.  You'll need to time a move past a Mad Mushroom, but you'll get a Red Keygem.  Take the Red Keygem back up the pole and head left as far as you can.  You'll find a pole, climb it and you should get a Blue Keygem.  Now go back down the pole, and hop in a small pit--you'll open a Red Door using your Red Keygem.  Near another Mad Mushroom, there's a switch--turning on this switch turns on an elevator right above the Red Door you opened.  Wait for the elevator to come down to you, hop on it, and head through the arched doorway.  Open the Blue Door, and you've rescued a Council Member!"
