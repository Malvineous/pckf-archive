		"content": "Just to set the record straight, Duke II uses the same video mode as Cosmo.  That's why it can only display 16 colours at a time.  It uses the VGA hardware to override those 16 colours, but because of the way the VGA works you don't actually need to run in VGA mode to do that.  A prime example is when you load the game, it fades out the DOS text screen to black (as many VGA games did in that era.)  The DOS text screen is actually a *CGA* video mode, so in this case the VGA is altering the colours of a CGA display mode.<br /><br />The Duke II palette may look like it uses about 58 colours, but it only uses 16 at a time.  Each full screen graphic (e.g. the story, main menu, etc.) uses a different palette, but it's still only 16 colours at a time.<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"
