I saw them live last night, and not only did they completely rock, but I met them afterwards and they were really cool guys.<br /><br />They have sort of a progressive art rock sound that's really too hard to describe, you have to listen to their stuff.

You can here a few of their songs on their website - [url=http://www.dredg.com/]www.dredg.com/[/url][url=http://spatang.com/ck][img]http://spatang.com/ck/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [url=http://spatang.com/cosmo][img]http://spatang.com/cosmo/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [url=http://spatang.com/nukem][img]http://www.spatang.com/nukem/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [img]http://spatang.com/scrobblersig.php[/img]"
