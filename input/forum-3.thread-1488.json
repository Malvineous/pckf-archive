I gave him a copy of the game last night and is currently revamping to make it faithful to the one in the game.<br /><br />Thanks for the hosting offer TMST [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  I think for the moment Flickr will do, however feel free to grab it from there. Until I have a definate green-light I feel there is little point in going overboard and getting everyones hopes up.<br /><br />Exams have just started here at uni, I will of course keep you updated during them, but no work will be commenced on the film during this 3 week period<br /><br />Regards,"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mischief.gif[/img]  <br /><br />In what I've read from his posts, he seems to know what he's talking about and has the capabilities to pull off a Keen movie.<br /><br />I'm not going to make a comment on whether he'll complete the movie - that's not for me to call. But whatever happens, he's got my interest in it.<br /><br /><i>Edit: Gargdamn ezcode screwed up...</i>"

If he can at least make us like a trailer then that would make it alot more belivable in my opinion. So yeah.<br /><br />Another thing you gotta remember is movies are just somthing you 'make' it takes alot of time and effort to make not only a rpofessional movie, but one that will actually be *good*.<br /><br />Theres only one movie that i know of that was done on a very short time scale and turned out good, and thats Disneys Aladdin."

		"content": "ive seen a few of them, and that other one 'the pirkinning'. They were excellent fan creations, however there is a large difference in what we are trying to achieve with CKGG<br /><br />Those fan-movies are deliberate in cloning the star trek universe, we are not planning on doing that with any existing universe. We are going to do something of our own. A lot of what the movie is about is centered on keen, how he is and his relationship with other people. The role of 'Commander Keen' is a way of expressing his irritation with others in not understanding his genius. I dont want to give too much away about the plot, but we want to create a more 'human' film than 'this is a fan movie, look at the effects'. That is not to say we wont have explosions, space-ships and planets being invaded though! A LOT of the movie is sci-fi.<br /><br />I personally think it will be a better film as a result<br /><br />So yes, it will be better :P Effects will be much better too."
