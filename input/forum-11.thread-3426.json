		"content": "That's a nice rendition of Run Like Smeg, yet there are some things that keep me from accepting it as a complete remake.<br /><br />The percussion is too soft--the sharpness of the cymbal and claps throughout the MIDI help make the tune work.<br /><br />The chords in the background (what's the term for a fast succession of morphing chords?) sound trippy, but get drowned out by the rest of the song, and don't seem to fit the rhythm in some places. The harmony tracks blend in too well also.<br /><br />They lose the tranciness that makes this song so classy... I can't really explain why, but you should be able to notice just by listening. I think it's to do with not having a clean enough space between them.<br /><br />It sounds like there are two overlapping tracks for this part of the song in the MIDI, with slightly different pitches, but I don't recall from when I was perusing the file a couple of months ago.<br /><br />It also doesn't feel like the chords are flowing right... in the MIDI they go up and down in a similar fashion to the bassline, whereas in your rendition the chord pattern sounds somehow shallow. Listening to it carefully, I think you're cutting some notes short.<br /><br />Speaking of the bassline, it's too... relaxed. The MIDI sounds almost cheerful, energetic. This MP3 sounds like it's laying back in a bean bag half asleep. The slap nature of the instrument is probably at fault here.<br /><br />The lead is too soft and echoy. You'd be better off with something that sounds more like a guitar. \"Nice\" virtual instruments are overrated. These songs don't need realism--that's the magic of electronica.<br /><br />Nonetheless, noble effort thus far. It's great to see someone tackling these wonderful songs.<br /><br />What software are you using to construct these?"
