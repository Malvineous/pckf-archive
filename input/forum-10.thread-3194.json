If you're Christian, and live in the US of A - does this seem crazy  to you?<br /><br />I personally had to pause the movie every 10 minutes as I couldn't handle the brainwashing of young kids in the way it's shown.  It's disgusting, and I'd like to believe that what's portrayed is the extreme, because, after all, the US has a lot of power and sway and say in the world.<br /><br />-- discuss? --------------------<br />[url=http://www.szevvy.net]www.szevvy.net[/url], for all your Wombat needs.

This seems kinda... messed up. I'm going to have to watch it for myself now.<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-shikadi.gif[/img] <br /><br />Or not. I would probably not watch the whole thing. Those kind of movies are disturbing to me. Especially how they made it a \"camp.\" When you take someone away from society and any other kind of normal, outside influences you can more easily influence their minds. This can be good or bad but in all ways it is brainwashing. They have NOTHING ELSE TO do except what they are told. (Pray, what to think etc.)-----------------------<br />The end of this post.
