		"content": "I hurt my right knee today. You know those cars that have the front seats that must be pulled down so that one can get out from the backseat? I was in one of those, on the backseat, and when got out there I tripped over and fell right on my knees on hard asphalt from the car. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img]  My right knee hurts so much.. It's hard to walk, sit, and don't know how I should keep the leg. Naturally I don't want to take 'painkillers'..<br />GAAARG! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img]  I hate tripping over. Glad there were no other cars that could've driven over me when I was on the street. I should be more careful perhaps.<br />Oh, and strangely the left knee isn't hurting at all. Perhaps the right one hit the ground earlier and caused the other not to impact the ground so much.
