[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dead.gif[/img]  Last year, I didn't try to write a book but I did wright some of a story. It was an alternate reality set in World War 1 era. I still like the idea bit this year I am going in a Scfi direction. I doubt that I can do 500,000 words out of the story I have. And besides... my writing is so bad it would make you cry before finishing the first chapter.<br /><br />Hey... Is anyone going to do a Keen fanfic for Nanowimo? Eh... maybe it would be best not to.-----------------------<br />\"Tough guys wear pink\"<br />[img]http://img455.imageshack.us/img455/8978/mod21gb.jpg[/img]<br />\"But fat people buy lots\""
