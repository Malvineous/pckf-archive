Let's hope they do the Starcraft name justice, unlike what I've seen of modern (post-2000) Quake, UT and C&amp;C games.<br /><br />Still, I'm glad they haven't abandoned Starcraft. At least it's still Blizzard creating it, rather than some no-name spinoff company. News of this sequel means <b><i>almost</i></b> as much as an announcement of Tom Hall creating TUIT."

Maybe I was too hasty to say it was more of the same...<br /><br />It all depends on how they do it. For example... let us select an INFINITE number of units PLEASE! I mean putting a limit on units was a GREAT idea back in the dos days of Warcraft with keeping memory in check... it doesn't make any sense now though. (And makes having more than one base impossible.)-----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."

That's how all sc fans out there feel right now.<br /><br />The graphics may feel weird right now, but that's what everyone said about wc3 graphics. It just takes time to get used to.  <br />However, they did handicap wc3 by one thing.  Wc3 was much slower paced than wc2 was.  But judging by the screenshots, it looks like the 200 food limit from sc1 still exists."
