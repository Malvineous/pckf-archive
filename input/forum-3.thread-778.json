So i hope that Mark will ever finish all other ones.<br />Of course, i can finish them youself, but it's not so interesting, as waiting for new levels from Mark, because i'd like to see, what HE can.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-annoyed.gif[/img]:\"&gt; [img]http://classicgaming.com/cc314/encyclopedia/images/enemyk4-wormouth.gif[/img]"
