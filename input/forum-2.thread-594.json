The most likely problem is that you've done something 'bad' in your levelpack that makes Keen3 crash.  You could try it with DOSBox, or boot off a DOS floppy and run it in native DOS mode but chances are it'll crash at the same point, just with a different error (in native DOS it'll probably just lock up the computer.)<br /><br />The best thing would be to try temporarily deleting parts of the affected level, and then eventually you should be able to hunt down the bit causing the problem."
