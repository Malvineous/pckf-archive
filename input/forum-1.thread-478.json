I found it [url=http://ftp://bhs.broo.k12.wv.us/MegaGames1/GAMES/APOGEE/1DUKE.ZIP]here[/url].<br /><br />Inside that zip there's a catalog file from August 1991, I think. In that catalog Apogee tells about what games they were working on back in 1991.<br /><br />Inside that catalog there are some funny quotes:<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]We will release at least ten new games each year, so keep in touch![hr][/quote]<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy!<br /><br />Available September 20, 1991<br /><br />THREE AMAZING VERSIONS:<br />256-color VGA version:  $15 per volume, or $35 for all three volumes!<br />EGA version:  $15 per volume, or $30 for all three volumes!<br />CGA version:  $15 per volume, or $25 for all three volumes!                <br /><br />[This is the second Commander Keen trilogy.]<br /><br />UNBELIEVABLE!  INCREDIBLE!  INNOVATIVE!  AWESOME!  ADDICTIVE!  BRILLIANT!<br /><br />These words only begin to describe the second set of three Commander Keen games.  In this all new adventure starring kid genius Billy Blaze, a new alien invasion threatens to wipe out our very galaxy, the Milky Way!<br /><br />Amazing new features include:  3-D perspective, Star Wars-style text scrolling, sloped surfaces, multiple sound card support with brilliant music and digitized sound effects, and out-of-this-world graphics.<br /><br />Three versions available:  256-color VGA ($35), 16-color EGA ($30), and 4-color CGA ($25).

If it can't display all 256 colours at the same time, it's not 256 colours.<br />Also you couldn't/can't select from all 256 colours like already mentioned, but you can \"personalize\" the palette a little bit.<br /><br />Think about back in the CGA days.<br />I think the official colours were green, and amber, and... red, was it?<br />Soon enough people realised they could work on the values in order to get cyan, magenta, and white instead.<br />Maybe it was the other way around.<br />I'm not really knowledgable in this area, but I don't feel like looking it up right now.<br />Wikipedia probably has some info on this though.Retodon8<br />You live, you die, you are remembered, you are forgotten.

I had an old EGA image editor that presented the 64 colours as RGB values - you know how in Windows you can pick a value between 0 and 255 for each R, G and B value?  Well in EGA you can do the same, only the value must be between 0 and 3 (so think \"off, dark, medium and bright.\")  Given that each of these values uses up two bits, and there are three of them (two bits for red, two for green, two for blue) that's six bits all up - a total of 64 different possible combinations/values/colours.<br /><br />Then when VGA came out they extended it from six bits per complete colour, to six bits per channel (so six bits for red, six for green and six for blue.)  That's 18 bits all up for each colour, which gives you 262,144 possible colours, and you can use any 256 of them at one time.<br /><br />Interesting stuff...

So I'm not sure what would happen if you tried this on a true EGA - most probably nothing, but it may lock up the PC depending on how well (or badly) written the EGA's video BIOS is."

I think we were using CPU speed as a single number metric for computer power. It's a safe bet that most 2 Ghz machines are beefier than most 1 Ghz machines. I've got around 350 Mb of memory, so all my stuff fits without much swapping. Still, my machine run Linux much more smoothly than it ran Windows, even when Windows had a smaller workload. The family computer is at 2.2 Ghz with 256 Mb of memory and lags horribly.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/toughyorp.png[/img]"
