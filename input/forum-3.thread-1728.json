I chose Aliens ate my babysitter because... no one did it yet (I think). <br /><br />Anyway, I always thought of what Keen would find floating out in space with his Photachyon Transceiver so I decided to base it off of that idea. Here is the link.<br /><br />Link is dead, sorry.<br /><br />I tried to stay away from anything that would make it too ambient or noisy. I hope you enjoy it. If you don't.... eh whatever [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-crazy.gif[/img]  .-----------------------<br />Save a little money each month and at the end of the year you'll be surprised at how little you have."
