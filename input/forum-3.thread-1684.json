Well, I noticed I don't have the required skills at all, so I tried to draw something other.<br />It's amazing how much time drawing can take.

I drew that picture in Paint and added the texts in Paint Shop Pro. In paint I used 2x2 \"brush\" and you can see it..<br />Tell your commments..<br /><br />[img]http://keengrid.net/keenrush/conversation.png[/img]<br /><br />PS. That non-green person in the picture is somewhat like me. Those are supposed to be eyeglasses, but they probably look like big eyes..<br />As well, notice that I wouldn't be like that on real life.

Like using people on the forum, or would you make them up?\"<br />IIRC I said they would be imagination characters, meaning I'd made them up. Naturally they could have some charasteristics of some members. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  But anyways, I was thinking about making the main characters two university students that live in the same flat. They're both Keeners, lame, and so on. They'd have allkinds of crazy stuff happening to them.<br /><br />\"Do you really have orange-y hair? Or is it more brown?\"<br />No, it isn't orangey.. I selected that colour because it looked the best. One can't probably make the hair just right shade of colour by using only one colour. Yeah, I guess more brown -- but not brown. Well, it's hard to explain.. And nobody cares. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />And Spleen; I'll draw more later.
