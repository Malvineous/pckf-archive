With a lot of my cartoon illustrations, I tend to follow the northern Renaissance concept of \"perspective lolwut???\" and just place things wherever I think they look good.  My professors would shoot me.  I'm also more accustomed to drawing females and rarely do kids, so I'll bet that's where that's coming from.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]What was the inspiration for that bizzare picture?[hr][/quote]<br /><br />Haha, you've seen that before?
