Someone is actually *doing* something Huzzah!<br />[hr]<br />[hr]<b>Levelass</b> People here are too lazy to flame.<br />[hr]<br />It seems someone's trying to get a message across.<br /><br />So, why is it that we're all so 'lazy'? What goes through your mind when you try to work on a project that you feel is of some significance, to the Keen community or otherwise? What is it that inhibits your persistence and keeps you from seeing something through?<br /><br />Of course there's the obvious \"This sucks and it's too complicated\" aspect, or \"I don't have time for it\", but I'm curious as to what lies behind these reasons.<br /><br />I'll post my own response later. I'm too lazy right now."

After the distraction is taken care of, I'd have once again completely forgotten about the project.<br /><br /><br />I guess it's not so much that I don't feel like completing projects, it's that I keep forgetting that I'd ever thought of them in the first place that is my problem."

Saturdays, if I'm not going out and doing college-related music stuff (performances, conferences) I'm hanging out with friends, finding time to decompress.  I don't feel like doing ANYTHING during those times--I will literally just sit on my keyster and just watch whatever's going on.  Movies are great for this.<br /><br />I've started working on things on the side, though, while I have free time at work--I spent the past 2 weeks looking into the Bounder thing over at K:M and finally realized why it wasn't working--it's something totally beyond me.  That means that, next time I have free time, I'll be working on graphics instead of patching stuff... but I've got midterms this week and next.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>  <br /><br />Long story short: I'm not in high school anymore, and I've got lots of commitments that are more career-valuable than Keen."
