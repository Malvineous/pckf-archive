Also, life is lacking in variety.<br /><br />Vorticon IV is lovely, but possibly a little too like Earth in terms of civilization.<br /><br />Gnosticus IV was a close second for its astonishing variety of life and environs to explore.  But it seems to be lacking in tourist infrastructure.<br /><br />Korath III is crazy-looking from space.  If there was more to see there then I might go there.<br /><br />I chose Fribbulus Xax because it has the kind of wierd environment and alien species combined with the technological-ness that I like.  As for teh problem of the unfriendly aliens, all I really fear are the giks.  Those things have gotten the better of me SO many times...!"
