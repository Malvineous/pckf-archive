Billy put on his helmet and transformed into Commander Keen- defender of the universe!<br /><br />Unfortunately, Eliza was right next to him, and he didn't notice her, so his identity was revealed to her. When Keen found out, he said to her \"You've been abducted too?? Golly, gee, you cough me tranformin'. Please don't give out my identity!!! Or I will be at more risk!! You don't want to lose me!!\" Eliza said \"I wouldn't dare tell!\"<br /><br />Keen searched for Mortimer and aliens while his wife looked for her purse and her cell phone. Keen found out this \"UFO\" was really Mortimer's ship. Keen grabbed his N Stunner and was cautious. Eliza Blaze saw Mortimer and said \"do I know you?\"<br /><br />Mortimer saw her and said \"Yes, I am Keen's cousin. His evil cousin.\" Eliza said \"Well being evil isn't good!\" Keen saw Mortimer and shouted to Eliza \"Honey, look out!\" Mortimer shot his N Stunner and nearly hit (and stunned) Keen's wife, but Keen saved her from being stunned.<br /><br />\"Thank you\" said Eliza.<br /><br />Don't hit that dial, 'cause Chapter 2 is comin' your way!<font color=\"BLUE\">Signed, Harvey Smith<br />A proud member of the beta testing society<br />\"I help entertain!\" -Harvey<br />Tough guys have no table manners![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopefish.gif[/img]</font>"
