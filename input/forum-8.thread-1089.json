The one in the thread isn't a one shot, and in fact has been in development for years.<br /><br />I'm surprised you noticed the connection to Mortimer's Mayhem.  It inspired me to write the first story, which was basically a sequel to it (though, aside from that, there were few connections between them).  Unfortunately, Adam's site went down shortly after I submitted it to him, and, thinking his story had been lost, I eventually sent it to Flaose on CC314 instead.  Ironically, Mayhem reappeared, and if I recall correctly, it had actually been <i>modified</i> slightly to fit my story - totally wrong, I thought, as it had inspired \"The Ancient Ending\", and not the other way around.[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Just remember that this is the year of the elite devil.<br /><br />1337 + 666 = 2003[hr][/quote][img]http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3852/sheepsmall0sf.jpg[/img]"
