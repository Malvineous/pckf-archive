I was surprised to find that the first name on the list... was actually about me.<br /><br />[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22Andrew+Stoltzfus&btnG=Search]Galaxieretter[/url]<br />(It was on my computer anyway.)<br /><br />So I told the idea to my friends sitting around me and they all did it with varying results. Most of the ones who participated didn't end up with themselves, but some of them did. We had to go back to programming when the teacher noticed something was up.<br /><br />But this gave me the idea to try the people on the forum  and see if I can find out more about my fellow Keeners. I typed in the names of the members who actually had their names in their profile.<br />The results were interesting...<br /><br />First off I started with the only member who's name I could remember.<br /><br />[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22Harvey+Smith&btnG=Search]Harvey[/url]<br />-Too generic Mr.Smith.<br /><br />Then just started clicking on the members that I came across when looking at posts.<br /><br />[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22Adirael+Dean&btnG=Search]LevelLord00[/url]<br />-Ouch [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mort.gif[/img] <br /><br />[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22Xkylyr+Rauh&btnG=Search]XkyRauh2001[/url]<br />-[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mortlol.gif[/img]  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mortlol.gif[/img] <br /><br />[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22David+Peck&btnG=Search]Mr12000[/url]<br />-Hmm, I don't think that's you.<br /><br />[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22Stephen+Currie&btnG=Search]CommanderSpleen[/url]<br />-Apparently we have an author.<br /><br />[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22Andrew+Kepple&btnG=Search]Too Much Spare Time[/url]<br />-YEA!

Cool.<br /><br />Q90 - Oh, you don't want to look... Trust me, you don't want to look.<br /><br />[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22xtraverse&btnG=Search]Xtraverse[/url]<br />-Well... That was expected.<br /><br />Oh and if I missed you... I'm sorry. There are more people here than you might think.<br /><br />Fun... Now I need to go do math homework that I will blow off while I draw.-----------------------<br />\"The Adventures of Commander Keen\" issue #1: [img]http://img93.imageshack.us/img93/8904/wid1kx.png[/img]<br />\"Fat people buy lots\""

Then I discovered computers and my dominating passion became programming and later game development. Writing's still right up there, though.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />The development of the hardware, and the greater ability to express every idea that flies into a programmers head, mean that game creators have made the new games congested with every technique in their power. The basic games behind all this are so blurred that people cant catch up. We should go back to basics  like Pac-Man  and play in an easier, more relaxed way. -Toru Iwatani<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
