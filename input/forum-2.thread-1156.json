I'm new to those Commander Keen forums and I feel like I should have joined years ago, as this seems a pretty active Keen forum!<br /><br />Well, I just wanted to let everyone know here I'm creating a new Commander Keen fangame in Multimedia Fusion. The short name for it is Keen:Return, the long name is Keen: Return to Gnosticus (I wanna change the Gnosticus in there!), and it's a game about the bounders having become mad on the planet in Keen4.<br /><br />Don't worry, this fangame won't suck, as I am pretty good with MMF and certainly don't use the sucky standard movements. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   <br /><br />The game will feature the SMF ripped music too (those sound closest to the originals!), and *maybe* some remixes. I'll do my best on the movement / gameplay stuff too. And of course, all original graphics, which I hope to add some of my own graphics too (but ONLY if they fit). In short, I hope this will play just like a Keen4/5/6 game, but more extended. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   <br /><br />No screenshots or other stuff yet, not even a RELEASE DATE as I just started it out a few days ago.<br /><br />Okay then. Soo hello again. Hope I'll be welcome here. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]   <br /><br /><br /><b>LATE EDIT</b><br />I thought I should just tell you people I'm in an amateur non-profit games creating team called The Black Wizards Soft.<br /><br />Our site is [url=http://Blackwizards.sitesled.com/]over here[/url].<br />But news on my game is put more often on my own site (see profile) and, of course, this topic."
