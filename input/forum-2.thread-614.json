I simply *loved* it, but my PC crashed and I was never able to recover the files from it. I really really want to get it back. I have seen the (screenshots of the) official Keen games, but it was none of them, I'm sure. This game I was playing had this boy jumping around on a pogo stick, squelching turtles (Mario-like) and things like that and the graphics was simply awesome!<br /><br />I've search the net a lot to find this program but can't. Please help me! I really hope you can."
