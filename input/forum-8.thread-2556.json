So I opened it up only to find that there was no unread thread.<br /><br />Odd...<br /><br />I figured that KeenRush probably just deleted a spam thread or something. So I went back to the main page and I happened to glance over at moderators bar.<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/WhereistheKeenRush.png[/img]<br /><br />What happened to Keen Rush and Xtraverse? And why are there no moderators for the Miscellaneous Polls or The Theater? Is my computer just acting weird or do other people see this as well?<br /><br />Edit: Changed \"is\" to \"are\"-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Blegdandsmeegdbanner60copy.gif[/img][/url]"
