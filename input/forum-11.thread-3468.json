I felt the levels were paced in such a way as to introduce new challenges gradually, and yet reward players who knew what they were doing already.  But with episodes 2 and 3, the whole pacing felt wrong, the level designs were less interesting, and the overall \"cheap\" factor added up.  <br /><br />I defy anyone to clear the first level in Bio Menace episode 3 without getting hit.  Just try it.  Those friggin' land mines are nearly impossible to see without randomly tossing grenades.  Or do I just suck?"

The first episode is mouthwateringly classy and lives in your memories as one of the greatest things to ever exist, and then you get the other episodes and they turn out to be the same old routine with slapped-together, reused ideas.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />A concerned member of the Preservation of Endangered Spleens Society<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
