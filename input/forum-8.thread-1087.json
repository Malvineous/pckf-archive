(Don't understand what he means by \"The word is go on Iran and we ain't got long.\") But seeing its a conspiracy forum, and the name is \"Godlike Productions\", I wouldn't start taking it to seriously...

In fact, people have been foretelling it pretty much since shortly after we \"won\" the war in Iraq. I personally don't know enough about the situation to give an accurate opinion on how likely it is, but as I'm a cynic I assume that it's inevitable.
