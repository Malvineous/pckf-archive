The original spelling for the name was \"Duke Nukem\"; however, during the code fix stage between v1.0 and v2.0 of the original game, Apogee found a character overseas named \"Duke Nukem\" that was thought to be copyrighted. So, for v2.0 of the original Duke game, the name was changed to \"Duke Nukum.\" Then, during the programming of the next Duke Nukem game (Duke Nukem II), it was discovered that the character they found overseas was not copyrighted after all -- and so the original name was reinstated. \"Duke Nukem\" is also the spelling used in all successive games that featured the character.<br /><br />The spellings \"Duke Nuke 'em,\" \"Duke Nuke'um,\" \"Duke Nuke'm,\" \"Duke Nuk'em\" or other variations are not, and were never, correct.   The correct spelling of the game is \"Duke Nukem\".[hr][/quote]"
