Flying cars by 2000!<br /><br />KR's Father: Aliens will land and teach us space travel! By 2000 we will have protein pills, flying cars and weather machines!<br /><br />KR: Gosh, is it 2000 already? Just think of what we'll accomplish in err... 2050!<br /><br />KR's Son: One day man shall fly! Just as soon as the remaining infidels in australia are destroyed. All hail Allah!<br /><br /><br />I think people both under and overestimate (Misoverestimate?) technological progress. With nothing but dreams it was believed that things like paving the planet, terraforming Mars, personal jetpacks and the like were possible, no one ever saw the rising oil prices and global warming. And who foresaw the rise of the cellphone? The laptop? Ipod? Whatever the future contains, it will be less space travel and more TV, be assured.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
