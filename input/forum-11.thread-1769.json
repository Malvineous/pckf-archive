[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]   <br /><br />EDIT: There's these fun little joystick things called TVgames. They aren't all arcade games, but they have namco and atari. I have one with pacman, digdug, galaxian, rally-x (which i've never heard of), and bosconian (so fun!)!<br /><br />My top 10 games are:<br /><br />1. Bosconian (hours of fun!)<br />2. Centipede and/or millipede (got the 3D version! Fun!)<br />3. Pacman (gameboy or tv? either are fun!!)<br />4. Digdug (I \"dig\" this game!)<br />5. Galaxian (more fun than space invaders, IMO)<br />6. Space invaders (theres one in DOS called space commanders, the first one i played)<br />7. Galaga (w00t, fun! Never actually played it, though.)<br />8. Mario (fun! sorta)<br />9. Donkey Kong (played it on the internet, and in an arcade once)<br />10. Tetris (not really one of my favorites. I just couldn't think of 10)<br /><br />The only games i've played/seen in an arcade are:<br />*Galaxian (only seen it. Never played it.)<br />*Centipede (either this or millipede. Cant remember)<br />*millipede (either this or centipede)<br />*donkey kong (i think i played it. Cant remember)<br />*pacman/ms. pacman (played)-Genius314"

The hard drive blew up in it a couple of years ago, but it still works, it's just slower than it used to be - they don't make things like they used to [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img] <br /><br />I've actually still got the first computer I ever owned - an Intel 8086 XT, with 640KB RAM and *two* 5.25\" floppies (they were only 360K double-density drives though, I had to wait until my 286 before I had a 1.2MB high-density drive.)  That was the first PC I ever played Commander Keen on.  In hindsight I'm surprised it was actually fast enough to play Keen!  Only the early Keens though, IIRC Keen 4+ were too big to fit on a single 360KB floppy.  (And Keen Dreams didn't surface until many years later...)"
