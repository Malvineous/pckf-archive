Well anyway I have set on my main page to display the 5 most recent visitors. (That is how I found most of the keeners who are on there.) Just now I logged on and saw that someone named \"TheUniverseIsToast\" who visited my site. Obviously interested I looked into the dude.<br /><br />[url=http://theuniverseistoast.deviantart.com/]TheUniverseIsToast.deviantart.com/[/url]<br /><br />Apparently he is starting a new webcomic called \"The Universe is Toast.\" The story is set about 5 years after the events of Aliens Ate my Babysitter. (That's what is says on the site. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]   )<br /><br />The person doing this is trying to be somewhat anonymous but I figured out that the person who is making this is also the Deviant Art user Reanimashun. [url=http://reanimashun.deviantart.com/]Reanimashun.deviantart.com/[/url]<br />Reanimashun is or at least WAS working on another Commander Keen project but I don't know if he is still doing that.<br /><br />Anyway thought you all might be interested. I'm keeping my eye on this. This will be what... the third Commander Keen related comic. (TMST's and mine are the only two that I can think of.) Personally I am very excited about this. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Anyway you can all drop him a line at his AIM address at: nny138<br />Or on his deviant art page if you are signed up there.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/New-blegd-smeeg-banner-60.png[/img][/url]"
