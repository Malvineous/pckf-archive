You will be trapped under water and if you hit the \"Drowning\" part of trhe water, you will drown underwater.<br />in the world of eternal weirdness: In the green area, after collecting the jump-powers and the key, before/after you open the door to the bird-power, but before you turn into a bird, leave the elevators one tile high. Trust me, if you leave them this high when you have two jump-powers in your inventory you will be able to jump onto the platforms with no trouble! Ignore the one that gets you to the door to the bird power, just jump onto the three red blocks and then jump through the door! You will make it! after turning into a bird go backwards out of the green area. Because you left small openings with the elevators, you will go into the area leading to the green area![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]   and if you return to the area where the start is (The start is blocked by the elevator so ignore it) and go through the small spaces you will go out side of the area your supposed to be trapped in![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]   Don't go back in yet, fly around a bit. If you enter the area where you exit don't exit, but go out the other side and you will be on the <b>OTHER SIDE</b> of the building![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]   now you can return to the exit, and exit as a bird.<br />Jill3<br />Castle: climb the red things and jump towards one of the walls stopping you from falling out of the castle hights. You will land right on top of it![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]   If you land on the left one of the right tower and fall of it in a straight line, you will be trapped in between two parts of the castle![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]   You can't jump high enough to get out, so you will either need to load an save game or exit your current game and start a new one.[img]http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2005/ga050705.gif[/img]"

You know how it ends just before Jill gets that last apple? If you hold down the [right] key before she makes that last jump up, instead of jumping up she'll jump to the right, and then you have control of her! So then you can jump around the level-end point, and get the apple. Unfortunately you can't leave the grove, and I haven't been able to find a way to gain control any earlier than that.[hr]<br /><br />RocketJess, blasting off again!<br /><br />[url=http://www.geocities.com/rocketjess]The Dragonkeeper's Lair[/url]"
