So..<br /><br /><b>Tell what kind of wisdom you have learned at PCKF, oh guardians of wisdom, and bearded ones!</b> [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smoke2.gif[/img] <br /><br /><br />Here's two pretty good tips I've learned here. There are probably a lot more but can't remember more at the moment.<br /><br />1. <i>If possible, read books in the language they're originally written in.</i> Big thanks to eK for this tip!<br /><br />2. <i>Your own emotions can (likely) make you interpret other people wrong.</i> Thanks Djaser.. I should've realized this one long ago.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-oldy.gif[/img] <br /><br /><br />And here's one piece of advice I can share:<br /><br /><i>When travelling, keep your money in several places! This way you don't lose everything or half of everything if you get robbed.</i>3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be. I <b>don't consider</b> that GBA game canon by any means.\""

Honour your debts and be indebted to your honours.<br /><br />5.) Loose an hour in the morning and you'll be chasing it all day.<br /><br />6.)
