Instead of being worried what people might think of you, you should be flattered that you've made such an impact in the community that people keep talking about you, even if it means a lighthearted joke here and there - it's all in good fun.<br /><br />If you still really don't like that image and can't live with it, it's up to you to figure out some way of shaking it off.  You'll have to come up with some other image and publicise it enough that people forget about the old one..."
