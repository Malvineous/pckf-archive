I've been working on Wombat as of late, and it's coming along nicely.<br /><br />It'll have to be somewhere other than szevvy.com as some chinese guy bought that when it expired and wants US$900 for it, *sigh*, so I'll have to think of a cool new name for my little place on the net.<br /><br />Stuff that works:<br />- I've got a lot of the text driver system up and running.

Still need to do much more work before all games that were supported work, but a lot is done.<br />This also means that, for example, once you define how an EGA image is stored (as in the example above), Wombat will automagically know how to modify it (it's the reverse of reading it, just a write out of the file tree with some UndrawEGA dropped in)<br /><br />- Unlzexe is built in<br />- Hex viewer, should you need it<br />- Preliminary support for animations, view those as a frame strip, one frame at a time, or animated.<br />- Mod projects.  Still getting there, but allows you to import a game's exe instead of the files.  Wombat will import all the game's files, and you can save the resulting project.  When you import files, it's saved to the project.  Then, when you want, you can write out a patch - which will generate an exe that you distribute.  This exe takes care of running the game and patching any files (in memory, no changes are made to the image on disc).  I've tested bits of this process and it seems to work for the bits I've tested.<br />- Fixes for quite a few games already, you find out quite a bit when rewriting all the game drivers.<br /><br />Any requests?Wombat is my little donation to all the crazy people who do stuff with old games.

I've got most of the underlying structures sorted out but surprisingly enough the most difficult part is turning out to be the GUI.  Using normal 2D window-surface style operations is amazingly slow, so I think I'm going to have to head down the OpenGL track for the map editor (which means I'm probably going to just put it off for even longer [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] )<br /><br />In fact I'm getting so tired of the GUI I've decided to write a command-line interface to the editor (which now makes it the uhh...fourth user interface to the same core code) which has turned out to be really nice, as it makes testing a lot easier and *really* speeds development (i.e. it's a lot easier to just convert an image to and from a .png file than it is to write a whole image editor.)  Unfortunately when it gets to the interactive editors that have no real existing equivalent (map editors, music editors, etc.) I'm gonna have to bite the bullet and do the GUI.  But that won't be for a while, at least [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

It took me a while to figure it out because of the weird bitplane thing.  As I understand it, there are multiple bitplanes - normally for EGA graphics you have one for red (4), green (2), blue (1) and intensity (8 ) - four planes total.  Sometimes a fifth for transparency or hit testing.<br /><br />Monster Bash seems to have an arbitrary number of planes, so instead of one for red (bitvalue 4) and another for green (bitvalue 2), you can have a single plane for red *and* green (bit value of 6 [4+2]).  I assumed this was some sort of compression, but some images end up larger this way so I don't know - what got me was how you're supposed to combine the image when you get overlapping bitplanes - say one for 6 and one for 2 (red+green and green only.)  I can't actually remember what I did now, I think I just combined all the \"1\" bits into the final image - but it came out properly, I haven't yet found a sprite it doesn't work with [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] <br /><br />Oh, and it's really fun how the image data is byte aligned (so the images are *all* a multiple of eight pixels wide) whereas the image itself might not be a multiple - so if you've got an image that's 10 pixels wide, the image data is actually 16 pixels wide (so you have to decode the image as if it's 16 pixels wide), but you then have to crop off the last six pixels so the final image you present to the user is only 10 pixels wide.  That got me for a while, because if you don't realise this, some images are fine (e.g. those that are supposed to be 8,16,24,etc. pixels wide) but for others the image is really badly skewed (to the point where you can't tell what it is, but it has a very distinctive look to it.)  Kind of annoying when the same code converts some images perfectly, and others not at all, and you think you've done everything correctly...<br /><br />Anyway yes, that's enough of my ramblings, ah the fun that goes into writing a game editor [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

It's also prone to get stuck in infinite loops when fed an invalid file, but I haven't yet worked out why - so using the XML descriptions for autodetecting file formats is out.<br /><br />So at the moment the XML stuff is only good for describing group files (files that contain other files, like duke3d.grp, cosmo1.vol, etc.)  I haven't even started thinking about things like images yet.  The XML itself isn't too bad though, have a look at the currently working XML code to describe [url=http://www.shikadi.net/pckf/c-vol-cosmo.xml]Cosmo's VOL files[/url] if you're curious - but the C++ code is much more complex (it even includes a whole [url=http://spirit.sourceforge.net/]generic language parser[/url] to evaluate the expressions in the XML file.  That bit is *very* elegant, but it does add to the overall complexity.)<br /><br />So I'll be leaving the XML system in, but it's now a much lower priority than it used to be [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

I originally had planned to do something similar to what you mention with the driver realising there's no offset and summing all the sizes, but then I realised that any variation on that system would require modifying the code - e.g. if a format has no offsets, but it does have extra info in between each file, or if the next file starts at a multiple of say 512 bytes (so you have to round up each file size to the nearest multiple of 512 to find out where the next file starts.)<br /><br />Granted this sort of thing is uncommon at best, but I still wanted the parser to be as generic as possible so you could implement these sorts of schemes without changing the C++ code.  That's half the reason why it's become so complex, instead of assuming things and hardcoding those assumptions to keep things simple, I've tried to make it so generic that there are no limits to the formats you can describe, and boy that makes for a *lot* of code [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

The other possible problem is that Wombat might not be detecting whether it's Keen 5 or 6 properly.  The issue is that I stupidly didn't back up Wombat 0.4, and the only source I've got is for 0.5 which is clobbered beyond belief, and I thus can't do 'hotfixes'.<br /><br />Wombat 2 will work differently in regards to Keen - it'll use the Huffman tables etc that are present in the exe itself.  So, it'll test the relevant exe to see if it needs to run it through unlzwexe, do so if necessary (unlzwexe and a few other exe unpackers are  in-built and automatic for exes), take an MD5 checksum of the result and use a lookup table to determine where to get the data it needs.  This way, it'll only work for known versions of Keen, and having the guarantee of using the same data as the exe itself should mean everything works like a dream; hopefully [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] .<br /><br />So just sit tight for now.------------------<br />[url=http://www.szevvy.net]www.szevvy.net[/url], for all your Wombat needs.

For example, instead of listing all the operators on page...oh yes, page numbers would be good too...well, instead of listing all the operators when you're trying to explain how operators work, you could maybe explain how addition works, and then say \"for a list of all available operators, see page X\" which is in the quick reference.

Palettes are messed up in about 4 images - as you can't refer to data from other packed files from within a packed file...so if I'm drawing an image in intro.pak, I can't use a palette from dune2.pak...yet.<br /><br />In other good news, all versions of Keen 5, all versions all Keen 4 except the beta/demo, and all versions of Keen 6 except the demo and promo work correctly.  Yay.<br /><br />I've also added an, IMO, pretty nice feature to the hex viewer - I know some people here will like it...the ability to align on non 8-bit boundaries.  You can, for example, view all the data in a file as 9-bit numbers to make it easy to find LZW compression, etc.<br /><br />I'm also working on hooking up level actors in the same way that levels are currently being scripted - and draw the sprites.  I'm sure someone here once wanted this for Duke 2; so enemies in a level will draw as proper Duke 2 enemies, etc.  There's a few issues I have to get around (making sure that only the first frame is being drawn as opposed to all frames), but it's looking very feasible.<br /><br />After that...about 35 bugs, and a big spreadsheet of 'things to investigate and things to make better'. *sigh*<br />------------------<br />[url=http://www.szevvy.net]www.szevvy.net[/url], for all your Wombat needs.
