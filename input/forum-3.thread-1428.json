The left feet gives indeed some depth but the rest of the yorp is pretty much flat. Especially the eyes look like a road sign, you should use some skin fold to change that unless you want to keep your style really simple. <br />I don't want to negative but you asked for opinions.<br />I agree with you that the feet are difficult to do, keep practicing but I also agree with Xky that they don't look that bad.<br />-----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Falling.gif[/img]"
