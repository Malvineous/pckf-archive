Credit cards are very useful - especially for buying expensive items that you want purchase protection on, such as computers - but it's a bad idea to rely on them for day-to-day finances. If you don't plan to buy anything expensive, there's no point having one. (It's still a very good idea to have some sort of electronic payment, though - I have a debit card which I would have trouble living without)[url=http://last.fm/users/grafix5000/][img]http://toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobbler.png[/img][/url]<br />[url=http://toxicsheep.com]toxicsheep.com[/url] | [url=http://commanderkeen.org]coming up next...[/url]"
