It's an interview by IGN where Palmer (\"the man responsible for the Game Boy Color port of Commander Keen\") answers their questions (duh).<br /><br />I was about to post this in unofficial games section only because Keen GBC doesn't deserve the title of an original  Keen game. I don't consider it official at all, but posted it only here just because some other mod or admin might move the topic if I placed it elsewhere.<br /><br />Try not to cry!

What's changed?</i> <br /><br /><b>Palmer</b>: <i>It is very close to the PC game. There were certain Keen PC titles that we could not use, however the ones we could use, we tried as hard as possible to keep the look and feel of the original game.</i>3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be. I <b>don't consider</b> that GBA game canon by any means.\""

Meh, whatever, I'm sure its something like that.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Palmer: They were very closely involved from day one right up to final approval; carefully editing what they felt appropriate, and in fact, Adrian Carmack, the artist for the original Keen games and co-owner/artist at id, did some tile artwork for Keen GBC. We were very happy they were so closely involved.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />Carmack: Palmer, I'm not happy?<br /><br />Palmer: Err, why?<br /><br />Carmack: Look at level 2!

I'm not intimately familiar with the story, but it just doesn't fit in with the other games' stories, basically.<br />I suppose I can imagine the Bloog and the Shikadi work together... almost, but along with a new robot race?<br />A new race should probably be introduced alone, like the other games did.<br />Then there's the enemies like the Badoing (kidnapped by the Shikadi for an unknown reason?) and Cyba-Mallow (mix between a cyborg and a marshmellow made by the Shikadi because they were bored???)<br />I can understand if Tom doesn't like it if someone else invents that the Shikadi have a ruler that is a big, one-eyed, orange head that apparently shoots rockets, and isn't very Shikadi.<br /><br />I suppose in the end it's just opinions, but the fact that Tom Hall, the designer of the IP, doesn't like it, is an indication of something.<br /><br />For instance the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time trilogy is a very popular one, and it actually is a pretty good translation of the old 2D gameplay, faithfull to the original, but with the right amount of added and, if necesary, changed elements.<br />I suppose it's likely to be a reboot of the POP universe, as a prequel (as suggested by the creators I think) the original games wouldn't make as much sense.<br />Where am I going with this anyway???<br />Never mind, I think I already made my point clearly enough before, agree with it or not.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  As for your argument, see my reply. I'm looking at the game as a Keen fan, not a GBC player. I understand the GBC is a different platform so the gameplay can't be identical, but if there are too many concessions (is that the right word?) the fans won't be happy.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]There are enough candy and toys to be found. Keen gathers random objects in his first adventure too, so I don't know why that's suddenly so bad.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />The candy and toys make sense, but the addition of other objects doesn't. Keen doesn't gather random stuff in episode 1. The only thing from the top of my head that's a bit out of place is the book. The random items on itself aren't that bad, but along with the rest the overall feel changes.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]So I have to repeat my question, why is GBC Keen unkeenish?[hr][/quote]<br /><br />Let's put it like this, for a big part it's the overal feeling, something that's impossible to accurately describe. If you play poker against someone who wins every single game, even if you play everyday for a year, you can be pretty sure he's cheating, even if you can't prove it, even if it's theoretically possible, just unlikely, that he'll win all those games. It's something in your gut that tells you. Different people have different guts, but for me this game doesn't seem very Keenish, even if I can't properly explain why.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Because of what I said in my previous post but I'll say it once more. GBC is not made by ID but by another companie that borrows the right. It's also released on a consolle while Keen is a pc series. Therefore the game doesn't count as a sequel, it isn't Keen 7, please take a loot at my Duke Nukem example and come with a better one if you disagree.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />The fact that another company made it doesn't mean it's not part of the series. The later Monkey Island games were made by a different team (though not company, not sure if you make that distinction), but they are still part of the series. If another company were to make a MI adventure, or even a racing game, I think most people would still consider it part of the MI series. I don't think there is an official description for the exact meaning of series; it depends on the context and who you ask. As for the different platform... Duke Nukem Manhattan Project is a part of the DN series even if it's not a PC game. <br /><br />What about the Sonic series for instance, newer games obviously don't come out on Sega hardware anymore.<br /><br />Looking at your DN example... I'd have to disagree. Adding a number is one way of indicating games are a part of a series, but definately not the only one. <br /><br />Think about Street Fighter, a series with a whole bunch of games with and without numbers. Or think Final Fantasy with a screwed up numbering, and usually unrelated stories. Still, the same series.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Now two quotes from you again that you need to explain:<br />Quote:It follows the other stories chronologically, and it's still a somewhat similar platform game at least.<br />Quote:Yep, well... I'm not intimately familiar with the story, but it just doesn't fit in with the other games' stories, basically.<br />Sigh....[hr][/quote]<br /><br />With the chronological comment I meant that the GBC game follows up the other games story-wise. Also it's a platform game, so in that way it's similar. I'm not sure how else I could word it.<br /><br />The second quote I really can't word in any other way. The story simply doesn't fit in with the style of the other stories. Again this \"style\" thing is impossible to explain, at least it is for me. Like I said, I didn't get to play the GBC game myself, nor did I read all of the actual writing in the game, so I can't judge things properly, but the enemy descriptions and overall story publicized on the web gives a pretty good indication alone anyway. I am assuming the sigh was because of the fact that I'm not familiar with the game, but as I said, I know enough for me to feel secure in making an overall judgement.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]I don't know I fell asleep half way.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />Hehe, I don't think you missed much, I seriously forgot, and still don't remember what point I was going to make.

It's pretty difficult to try to explain it.<br />As Ret8 pointed out, we are looking the game as Keen fans, not typical GBC players.<br /><br />Anyways, to answer Djaser, which I have been too lazy to do until now..

But I'm not one who has to compare them and say this one is crap, it's your contention.\"<br /><br />Sigh, well, let's see. First of all, as the stories clearly aren't written by someone who used to write them (Tom Hall most probably), the style is so different.<br />By the way, I know none terms for talking about writings or literature so pardon me.<br /><br />The story is boring. There happens nothing fun or stuff like in the originals (Keen stunning his parents, Bloogs capturing his baby sitter and leaving a message).<br />\"It's a normal morning for Billy Blaze. Half awake, he gets his cereal and sits in front of the TV, switches it on, and watches... static...\" is the worst start for a story ever!<br /><br />Compare it to the stories of other Keen games. The other stories in Keen 1-3 and Dreams explain briefly who is Commander Keen and then continue, keeping reader interested from the first words to the last. Here, on the other hand, the story couldn't interest player the least, and there's nothing fun or imagineous (may not be a word) in it. Nor there was there any reference to the surrounding Keeniverse nor any humour. Compare it to these first lines of Keen 4 story: \"After delivering a crippling blow to the plans of Mortimer McMire and recieving the praise of the Vorticon race Commander Keen returns to his home in the suburbs.<br />Here he was forced to go to bed at an early hour, and to eat mashed potatoes.\" [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img]  See?<br /><br />Keen GBC story is just dry. It could be a lot better if it started for example this way (I'm not saying that I'm good story maker), although a good story wouldn't save otherwise crappy game: \"Billy Blaze, 8-year old genius and intergalactic adventurer, woke up to what seemed just another peaceful day in the suburbs. Billy helped himself to a bowl of tasty Sugar Stoopies and turned on the TV to catch the morning news. Bad news for those wanting to see the news: there was nothing but static!\"<br />Although, I would've made completely different story and not made Keen to watch TV or anything like that. I wouldn't use anything 'subspace anomaly' in my story. Keen wouldn't need to look at his ComputerWrist in order to realize that something's wrong -- besides, what did he see in CW? Keen GBC story doesn't tell.<br /><br />The story doesn't sound believable at all. I'm surprised they didn't use vorticons in the story. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-rolleyes.gif[/img]  Why would the intelligent Shikadi (at least they seem intelligent to me, and I think Mortimer just says everything is dump) suddenly co-operate with dump Bloogs? And even if Mortimer is behind it (as he is), he wouldn't be so stupid to use the same creatures to do his bidding that once failed. And, WHY would they capture creatures from Gnosticus IV (that isn't even mentioned in the story)?!<br /><br />The story doesn't explain anything, it just says there are some three powerful plasma crystals (ah, that makes a lot sense) that only Keen has power to re-unite the crystals. WTG? First they said the enemies created three crystals and suddenly we hear the crystals should be united for whatever the reason.<br />And even his old arch-nemesis may have something to do with it.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img]  Yeah, as if Mortimer had already finished his plans to destroy the Universe.<br /><br />Not to mention the use of words in the story is poor and clumsy, and it's pretty annoying to read \"Commander Keen(tm)\" everywhere. Fucl you iD!! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img]  This story is a boring description how Keen goes to planet, it really doesn't offer any interesting story line. (Obviously this game was just done and then the team just whipped up some story.)<br /><br />Anyways, I could complain a lot more but I'm too hungry for that. Haven't eaten a meal for two days. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img] <br /><br /><br />\"So un-keenishnes=crap? Or can something still be Keenish and also be crap?\"<br /><br />Not always, but I thought you might have understood I meant that un-Keenishness is really bad in the context of Keen game.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-yawn.gif[/img]  Yes, an un-Keenish Keen game is crap.<br />And yes, some Keenish stuff may be crap too.<br /><br /><br />\"Anyway I find it doubtfull if Keen stands for great storylines. For example I never liked the idea of Mortimer because it was hardly worked out in Keen 3, and the collection idea in Keen 1 is not so much different from GBC Keen.\"<br /><br />Well, in my opinion the other story lines are great. In Keen 1 Keen is just exploring the mountains of Mars, and while he is away vorticons steal vital parts from his B-w-B Megarocket. Naturally we don't know yet that someone is actually controlling the vorticons. That is revealed as the story proceeds in the following games. Keen stories are really well done in my opinion, and have left things for the player to realize/find out. Best example of this is the letter in the end of Keen 5 -- instead of making Mortimer appear on some screen and saying the content of the letter they decided to write it in SGA and leave it for the player to decipher. Excellent work in my opinion.<br /><br /><br />\"Those games where made for the pc, the GBC has another screen size, another coller palette, etc.\"<br /><br />The screen size is different, yeah, but it's capable of showing 56 colours (and choose them from a palette of 32768 colours) at once so using white and pink could've been possible.<br /><br /><br />\"That's somewhat true, however it's still one of the most detailed games on the GBC most other games look rather blunt. I don't know why that is, memory isseus maybe? Or doesn't little details work out on a small screen? I'm sure there is a reason for and I don't think Palmer is to blame.\"<br /><br />I think it's just their style. Drawing a tile containing only pixels of one colour should take exactly the same effor than drawing a tile containing many colors. The same goes for storing them in the memory. (Unless they are using some really bizarre ways for both.) And if I remember correct GBC is faster than the olde 286.<br /><br /><br />\"GBC uses another color palette, for the same reason the original Keen has a white skin.\"<br /><br />Yes, in this game, but they could have used different colours -- for example those used in the original games. See my reply somewhere above.<br /><br /><br />\"I'se seen other peoples job on Keen sprites too, and I have to disagree. Xky's Keen (which is a great sprite) shows a smal body with a big head, in the official games Keen is tall and slim, the same goes for the GBC Keen. GBC Keen is therefore more true to the original. Basically what you're now doing it just giving your own interpretation of Keen, everyone has their own and so did the people of Palmer, I don't think that's a strong point.\"<br /><br />You may be right, probably I'm thinking of something ideal Keen, however, I can't actually define what makes Keen sprites Keen. There are many different Keen sprites (some with bigger head than others) and they still are Keenish to me. So, can't say it being only some physical properties that make the character Keen. However, in my opinion this GBC character lacks something Keenish, and thus doesn't look like Keen to me. And it's not only the distorted colours of GBC sprite. Dunno.<br />And, can't say Keen GBC being any truer to the original. Keen 1-3 and Keen 4-6 sprites are very different. There must be something wrong in the GBC sprite as many Keeners think it doesn't look Keen.<br /><br /><br />\"You're playing it as a rom on the pc...\"<br /><br />Yes, but can't imagine it being any better on the actual console.<br /><br /><br />\"Are you kidding me? Keen 4-6 have the different menu's from Keen 1-3, and so has Keen Dreams. Do you think that if Tom was still making Keen we would still have the same menu's anno 2006?\"<br /><br />Yes, they vary in the originals as well, but navigation feels different and isn't as good in this one and the password system is really annoying, and slow to use (I guess there's no way to save game to any memory card on such on GBC).<br /><br /><br />\"That's a new one. Please explain....\"<br />Well, the levels too were overall a lot different to those seen in the official ones. I can remember seeing hardly any solid walls. Were there any secret passages? Maybe I should try it again in some distant future.<br /><br /><br />\"Something different then things like 'he is a bastard, and he only cares for money and he hates us poor Keen fans.' Because you don't know!\"<br /><br />I don't think he (necessarily) hates us. But everything in my mind points towards the conclusion that this game is made just for money and nothing else. As said in that interview the guy would've wanted Doom or Quake, but had never dreamed of making a Keen game.<br /><br /><br />\"You don't know that. It's like saying that everyone who makes a bad mod/fangame hates Keen.\"<br /><br />I don't. (See above.)<br /><br /><br />\"Who knows but I'm sure that back when he started Keen he too wanted to get his wages.\"<br /><br />Yes, probably he wanted to earn money too, who wouldn't? It is his job, of course he has to earn money from it to pay his apartment, food, and such. But money never was (and still isn't) his reason to work on games. It's just a reward and not his goal. Anyways, you've probably read how they worked non-stop, eagerly making a revolutionary game and got pizza money sent to them so they could have something to eat, etc.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  Oh man, how I would love a pizza right now.. I really don't have money to spend to even get food every day! Ah.. I'm surely going to buy a pizza once I get home.. Kebab meat, pepperoni, pineaple..
