Anyone up for the challenge?<br /><br />I just need help figuring out the basic structure, like:<br /><br /><br /><br />A. What is the difference between Class vs. Property Manager?<br /><br />B. How do I get programs to use the #include files that I want it to?<br /><br />C. What's the difference between a solution, the projects, and what is their relation to the actual scripts themselves?<br /><br />D. What are different projects: CLR, Win32, General?<br /><br />E. On one of my attempts to figure out the program,  Icreated three little files on the mid-left window.  They were headers, sources, and something else. I cannot seem to find them/<br /><br /><br />I need to talk to people, and not read some help list that makes no sense to me.  Though posting is just fine, if you want my IM's, they are:<br /><br />YIM: globox88@yahoo.com<br />AIM: pitchblack44<br />MSN: goldphoenix99@hotmail.com<br />GIM: goldphoenix99@gmail.com~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

		"content": "A) Never used the Property Manager, the class view shows you classes in the graph layout<br />B) They must be in directories VC knows about.  Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer, and go to properties.  Under C/C++ you'll see 'additional include directories'.  An extra directories are in here, relative to the project directory.  Make sure you make changes for both debug and release if you're planning to compile a release build at some point.<br />C) A solution holds projects.  For example, you can have a 'MySweetGame' solution that has the game project, the engine project and the map editor project.  I'm not sure what you mean by 'their relation to the actual scripts themselves'.<br />D) They are all basically templates for creating default, almost empty project of different types.  Choosing CLR will create a blank project set up for .NET, Win32 will create a blank project for Windows (optionally with the WinMain function put in and precompiled headers set up) and General creates a blank project not configured for anything specifically - so a blank DOS window-type project.------------------<br />[url=http://www.szevvy.net]www.szevvy.net[/url], for all your Wombat needs.

Again in the properties tab (I don't have VS on this machine so I can't give exact instructions) there's a 'linker' option - within that or one of its children there's an 'additional library directories' or somesuch - add the location of your Allegro lib folder, and a 'additional libraries' - add the allegro lib.------------------<br />[url=http://www.szevvy.net]www.szevvy.net[/url], for all your Wombat needs.
