The characters have all just become too shallow and stereotypical.<br /><br />Anyway, there's a few others I read, but most of the good ones have all been mentioned already.  At the moment, I get the most laughs out of Order of the Stick.  It's pretty quality writing, from a D'n'D dork's perspective.  :-)[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"

		"content": "Let's see... for me (other than ones already listed), there's gpf-comics.com, tailsteak.tk, www.nedroid.com, and www.theaterhopper.com. I also quite enjoy www.filibustercartoons.com for its political humor (but he lives in the same part of Canada I do, so it makes more sense to me). <br /><br />I can try... first of all, I didn't mention dandyandcompany.com, because Grafix already did, but that's probably my favorite online comic. It's Looney Tunes inspired, and quite adventurous.<br /><br />Next, I should also mention that to get a really good feel of an online comic you really gotta go back into the archives and read everything. Because the entire archive of an online comic is available to you, comic strip creators can bring up stuff that happened years ago (which is a lot harder to do in newspaper comics).<br /><br />Okay, gpf-comics. There's about 7 years of history to this one, so you have to have a lot of time on your hands to read it now, but I think what impresses me most is the mix of characters. Most comic strip characters are just aspects of the character's own personality, but in this comic, the characters feel very different and engaging. It doesn't feel like these characters all came from one man's head. Plus, the main character is a computer geek who's staying pure until marriage... that's personally reassuring. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />I found Tailsteak.tk because of a comic strip he did called [url=http://oneoverzero.keenspace.com/]One Over Zero[/url]. If you can get through the first 100 strips, it turns into this really insightful comic strip where the characters are completely aware that they're comic strip characters, and it's a vehicle to start analyzing a lot of complex issues. Once he finished that comic, he made Tailsteak.tk. Half of the stuff on there is ho-hum, but some of it is quite brilliant.<br /><br />Nedroid.com - not really a comic strip, just a collection of strange and wacky ideas. Some of them are quite funny. (You didn't need convincing on that one.)<br /><br />TheaterHopper - It's pretty much just a pop-culture comic. Whatever movies are currently in theaters, that's what it comments about (80% of the time, anyways). It's really just an escapism comic for me... I hardly ever go to the movies any more, so it lets me know what I'm missing without shelling out 10 bucks every week.<br /><br />FilibusterCartoons - This is an online political comic. Something I've observed over the time I've been on the Internet is that the whole Internet is leftist. If it had been up to Internet surfers, George Bush would have probably gotten 2% of the vote (and PLEASE don't turn this topic into a political one just because I said that). So, it's nice to read a political comic written by someone in the same province I live in that takes fun of both sides (even though I'd probably categorize it as slightly right of center).<br /><br />You'll notice I didn't really mention artistic style in any of these. As much as I like to see beautiful art, that's not what I look for in my online comics. If I'm engaged by the characters and/or humor and it's not crude, I'll probably read it.<br /><br />(Of course, if you want great art in comics, I seriously suggest you check out www.sketchesandsquirrels.com... now THAT guy knows art.)[url=http://www.screenhog.com]www.screenhog.com[/url]"
