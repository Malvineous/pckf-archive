I didn't even know of the convention x.xxx.xxx,xx until I started coming across it in the past couple of years. Is 1,03 actually pronounced 'One point zero three'? That would just be wrong."

The ages are based around certain alignments, most notably regarding the centre of the galaxy.<br /><br />I've not heard any of these so-called prophesies you're ranting about of fire and the end of the world and whatnot. The only theory I've heard is that a great cycle comes to a close on December 22, 2012, ushering forth a new Golden Age. However, that same theory also states that it's up to us to make what we will of it, that it's a blank slate yet to be written."
