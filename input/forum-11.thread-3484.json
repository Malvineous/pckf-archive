The play process is not given. You must find out, how the things work. The are nearly endless ways to find the game end. Have fun! I try to make this game more popular outside Germany. The Game \"Robot Junior\" is FreeWare (the others are ShareWare). You can play this episode also good with only some German Knowledge. If not, here are some words: <br />Hilfe - Help, Spielstart - Game Start, Beenden - Quit, Benutzen - Use, Anschauen - Look, Ablegen - Placing, Verdoppeln - Double <br />Try!

What do you think about it?<br /><br />___<br />- We want  \"The Universe is Toast\" ! - [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-yorp.gif[/img]"
