In the registered version of Duke Nukem2, episode 3, level 3, you can fly off the top of the screen using an flame thrower to fly up a waterfall. Once you on the top of the screen, go left or right, and you'll end up stuck there. In order to get off the bottom of the screen, go to an waterfall, and you'll fall. You get stuck because there is no ceiling on the top of the screen, and the tiles at the very top of the level are solid. If you want to go across the screen, all you have to do is walk left or right, and jump over the waterfalls. This is useful for getting to hard-to-get-inside rooms in episode 3, level 3, and it can confuse your freinds if you say something like \"Duke is missing! Can you figure out why?\", but the biggest thing about it is that it's just fun to do. I don't know if this is possible in any other levels, but I doubt it is.[hr][/quote]<br />2. In the registered version of Duke Nukem2, episode 3, level 6, near the end of the level, on a roof, you can jump on an wall and fall on the other side of it... But now your stuck, and you'll have to load an save game. I'll take a screenshot of it soon, because it's hard to explain. I am the bad you are the ugly There is no good"
