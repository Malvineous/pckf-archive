I noticed that the ending ad tells something like Id Software wasn't going to publish the full game with Apogee as shareware (like what they did with Keen6, that has a 3 level demo).<br /><br />Why do I call it \"beta of a demo\"? Simple, this demo's Paddle War has a serious timing bug! You can't play Paddle War with the demo, or they did it intentionally so that for playing Paddle War correctly the player had to buy the retail version of the game. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Apart from that, the Help screen has a gray background, like the ending sequence of Keen 6 version 1.0, while the Apogee versions of Keen4 shareware and Keen5 retail have a red background, just like the Keen6 v1.4 ending screen. It's kinda interesting to have a small piece of Id Software story in my hard disk.<br /><br />EDIT: And it seems that the world map music for this demo/beta or whatever it is, is a sketch of the world map music Bobby Prince wrote for the final shareware version. And why do the demo levels have no music? Even the Keen6 demo had music! With this I'm sure it was a Beta of the Keen4 Demo.

Download Hex Workshop from [url=http://www.bpsoft.com/downloads/index.html]www.bpsoft.com/downloads/index.html[/url]<br />3. Right-click on the unlzexe'd exe, and click 'hex edit with hex workshop'<br />4. Down the very bottom of the window, from left to right you have: 'ready', 'offset: 0', 'value: somenumber', 'somenumber bytes'.  The value in 'somenumber bytes' is the size.  This is the first thing I need.<br />5. Go to edit-&gt;find.  Change 'type' to 'hex values', and set the value to \"000000009D000000A6000000\" (without quotes), then OK.<br />6. Remember how down the bottom you have 'offset: somenumber'?  The somenumber is what I need - this gives me the header offset.<br />7. Repeat steps 6-7 for the hex string \"6900B50096009A00\".  This gives me the huffman offset.<br /><br />I'd simply ask for a registered exe, apply patches and do everything myself...but that would be illegal, right?  This way it'd be legit, I in no way condone sending the exes of all the versions to szevvy@hotmail.com, in no way at all.
