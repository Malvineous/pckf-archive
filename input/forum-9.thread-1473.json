		"content": "It is now possible to control cockroaches (The so called robo-roach) by attaching electrodes to their antenae. It is also possible to control rats to a great deal by using electrodes implanted into their brains. Our knowledge of the mind and its relation to the brain increases steadily it two areas, neuroscience and charlatanry. (Including magicians, propagandists and con men.)<br /><br />We can be manipulated to a greater deal than ever before, and that most likely can only increase. There are those who would love to exert full control over people for their own ends, and this to a much lesser degree seems to be routine. Yet often we are not aware of it at all, subtle, in the background manipulations and suggestions preserve the illusion of free will.<br /><br />So the question I ask is, is a slave still a slave if they don't know they're enslaved?<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Cute bunny!"

It is composed of 'normal' people who impose their will upon others for what they see is the better good. If your parents discipline you, they are oppressing you, but probably wouldn't think of it as slavery. The question is then what you regard as oppression, or indeed slavery. Are you a slave to your boss? To your girlfriend? To your peer group?<br /><br />Also, society gives many benefits lone individuals don't recieve. (Such as a police force, which, while oppressing thieves, murderers and rapists with varying degrees of success makes the majority of us feel a lot safer at night.)<br /><br />Besides Djaser, my will is that you agree with me on all points, but not doing that, you're enslaving me.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]But what if it was true?

We are still we; nothing changes but only the view on humanity.[hr][/quote] <br /><br />Views are important; if the very core of our intelligence is false, if we really are nothing but machines, oh how much easier it is to shut down one of them, or a thousand or more. How much easier it is to control what is already just the product of other controlling factors, how much emptier is a life that was predetermined from birth. If I found my government had abandonded its ideals and become nothing more than an appearance of its former self, I should not support it. (I have, and I don't BTW.) so much more life.<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Cute bunny!"

The universe makes us who we are; therefore, we are given a destiny.
