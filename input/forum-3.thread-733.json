I wasn't paying attention too much, I was talking to someone on MSN, but... it was a commercial where there was this godzilla thing was destroying a city. It knocked down a building and behind it was this robot. Well they fell in love. (Whatever... it was a dumb commercial.)<br /><br />Well I looked at the screen as the scene changed. The robot bent over and behind it was a billboard on a building... I could swear to GOD it was SGA written on there. I did a double take but couldn't look at it before the scene switched.<br /><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br /><br />Ok so I found it online and took a screen shot of it. Turns out the characters look similar to SGA but aren't. <br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Oops.png[/img]<br />Oh well it was close...

Sometimes they are from spanish, french, german etc. but mostly from english.<br />Another use for katakana is company names that doesn't mean a thing.

So I was used to encountering Japanese alphabetic characters in computer games.<br /><br /><br />Interestingly, I was browsing through some Asian manga comics (sorry, I don't know which parts of Asia they were from) the other day, and I noticed that all the drawings of post-boxes (the things that you post your letters into, not the ones that you get your letters delivered to) had the symbol of the SGA letter \"H\".<br />_<br />T<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   So... yeah.----------<br />www.StrifeStrips.com!

But it also looks a lot like a lowercase 'b', so that's probably a coincidence.<br /><br />(I work as a Japanese interpreter, lol)<br /><br />'e' and 'm' look to me like they might be alluding to the simple \"pigpen cipher\", which was used in the American Revolutionary War (God knows why, though; it's a simplistic substitution cipher) and is now frequently employed by grade school kids.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Aah.
