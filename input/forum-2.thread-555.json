(remember since its keen you can only be hit once)<br />The only way to defeat mortimers giant robot is to shoot target switches on it and after the giant robot is destroyed mortimer appears from the wreakage ready to fight you.<br />Now its a one on one battle with mortimer in *3D* like in quake 2 when you fight the final boss, its like fighting two bosses and after the first one is defeated the second one appears from it but im not sure it can be done with quake 1, I can try though.<br />Keen finaly defeats mort by using the neural destroyer (new weapon) and walks to the universe destroying machine, presses all the buttons to open the fuse and you break it by either shooting it or jumping on it with the pogo.<br />If you ever seen the last level in quake mission pack 2, (I think) the end demo movie thing shows the player after destroying the machine jumps into the portal and it plays the conglatulations text.<br />I want to do something like that only after keen destroys the machine he escapes to the bean-with-bacon megarocket and flys away to the end text.
