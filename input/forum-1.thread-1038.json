		"content": "This had to be done sometime... no longer will annoying newbies have to ask us crummy questions ever again! I have compiled a load of crazy questions for your reading pleasure...<br /><br /><b>How do I get into the secret level in CK1</b>?<br />Explore the large city (not the ice city) which can be found at the far right of the map, go to the very bottom of the level to find a teleporter, which will lead you to the secret level.<br /><br /><b>How do I get into the secret level in CK2?</b><br />There is no secret level.<br /><br /><b>How do I get into the secret level in CK3?</b><br />Next to the boss level on the world map, the Loch Ness Monster, also known as 'Messie' will (eventually) pick you up and lead you to a small island.<br /><br /><b>How do I get into the secret level in CK4?</b><br />In the 'Pyramid of the Moons', grab the yellow key, use it to unlock the yellow door (not the door which unlocks the exit, but there's another yellow door), activate the switch and<br />gather all 12 Inchworms. They will form a giant foot. The giant foot will lead you to the secret level, 'The Pyramid of the Forbidden'.<br /><br /><b>How do I get into the secret level in CK5?</b><br />In the 'Gravitational Damping Hub', don't enter the exit, instead, press down, then jump on the arch in front of the exit. Walk left until Keen falls. Complete the rest of the level,<br />which will prompt you to leave via the 'Korath III Base' teleporter.<br /><br /><b>How do I get into the secret level in CK6?</b><br />Before entering the final level, wait for the satellite to pick you up.<br /><br /><b>How do I get into the secret level in Keen Dreams?</b><br />There is no secret level. If you have the Shareware Version of Keen Dreams, try level 7 or 8 for a BETA level.<br /><br /><b>How do I get into the secret level in Commander Keen for Gameboy Color?</b><br />There is no secret level.<br /><br /><b>What are the cheats for CK1, CK2 &amp; CK3?</b><br />Press G-O-D to activate God Mode (It must be activated each time you enter a level).<br />Press G-O-D to active No Clipping on the Map Level.

Debug mode can also be activated by typing<br />in 'keenXe.exe -nowait' on the DOS Prompt (where X is the corresponding episode).<br />Throughout the game, try any of these cheats...<br />F10-D - Demo Mode (Allows you to record demos, But they can't be viewed)<br />F10-G - God Mode<br />F10-I - Free Items (Keys, Extra Points, Swimsuit, Items)<br />F10-J - Jump Cheat (Allows you to fly by pressing jump)<br />F10-M Memory Usage (View Memory Usage)<br />F10-N - No Clipping (Allows you to fall through walls, Use Jump Cheat beforehand)<br />F10-T - Sprite Mode (Allows you to browse through all sprites in the level you are in)<br />F10-W - Warp (Select which level you wish to play)<br />F10-Y - Secret Cheat (Allows you to find all the secret areas in the level you are in)<br />There may be some more cheats than this, but they're quite useless.<br />Press B-A-T at any time throughout the game (without debug mode) to receive free<br />objects.

Once you finish the game, the ending will<br />be a little different...<br /><br /><b>Oooh, the 'F' word is in Keen 2? Where can I find it?</b><br />The word can be found if you look really hard in the level 'Paris Tantalus Rays', it's written in the Standard Galactic Alphabet, and is written in those thin yellow platforms. And the word isn't spelt as f**k, it's spelt as fucl.<br /><br /><b>How do I get Keen to moon me in CK4?</b><br />In the 'Pyramid of the Moons', stand on a moon and wait for a few seconds. Keen will moon you.<br />Afterwards, he won't moon you again unless you die and re-enter the level.<br /><br /><b>Is Commander Keen 2000 an official Keen game?</b><br />Of course not!
