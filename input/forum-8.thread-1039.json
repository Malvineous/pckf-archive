I first heard of it via an ad on Channel [V], a pay-TV music channel, and originally thought was some promotional thing they'd bought into. Now that I think about it (and research it), looks like the owners of the drink just managed to latch onto a sweet marketing deal.<br /><br />It's a horrible drink, though. I'm not a fan of caffeinated beverages in general, as I don't find the drug necessary. I do consume Red Bull on the rare occasion I'm consuming Jagermeister, but I tried V with it once and it was repulsive."
