Off topic rants often bring about some classy stuff that is otherwise buried.<br /><br />[hr]<b>KeenRush</b> I'd like to hear the news about the latest mods, and what's up with TUIT!<br />[hr]Yeah, mods go without saying. And if we heard anything about TUIT, or something directly from Tom Hall, that would be obvious news material.<br /><br />What I'd like to know about are the less community-impacting topics. For example, curiosities like <i>[url=http://p098.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumothercommanderkeenstuff.showMessage?topicID=1304.topic] Keen pictures I drew when I was a kid[/url]</i> and unexpected reunions as occurred in <i>[url=http://p098.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm17.showMessage?topicID=1190.topic]Isis II source code?[/url]</i>.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Shadow Master</b> (Is this an attempt to resurrect it?)<br />[hr]Sort of. It's an idea I've had for a long time, after noticing the frequency of MSN conversations with Keeners who don't visit the PCKF regularly to ask what's been going on, and my difficulty in summarising the interesting stuff.<br /><br />It's taken me a while to learn the necessary skills to make it happen. I just need an indication of what events and discussions really interest people."
