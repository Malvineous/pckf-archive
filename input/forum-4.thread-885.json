From the README:<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]CloneKeen is an almost almost complete open-source clone of the old classic DOS game, Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons by ID Software. CloneKeen requires the original game data files to work. You can play all three episodes of the game.<br /><br />CloneKeen currently runs under win32, using SDL. My hope is for CloneKeen to be ported to many other platforms.<br /><br />CloneKeen tries mostly to replicate the original game, however there are also a number of improvements, including smoother scrolling, better graphic effects in some parts of the game, and 2-player support.<br /><br />To my knowledge this is the only released attempt at writing a homebrew third-party Keen game that has reached this stage of completedness.<br /><br />The CloneKeen source may be freely distributed and modified as per the GPL, just please remember to give credit to the original author Caitlin Shaw.<br /><br />CloneKeen comes with one new level for episode 1 (shareware), and 2 new levels for episode 2. These levels are released under the same license as the rest of the program.<br /><br />CloneKeen also includes the Tile Attribute Editor used while making the game which allows modification of the level tile properties.<br />[hr][/quote]<br /><br />Check it out: [url=http://clonekeen.sourceforge.net/]clonekeen.sourceforge.net[/url]"

For a few minutes I didn't even remember that Keen source is not released, it took me while to realize you've coded this from scratch and not ported the code.

Otherwise, great!<br />As well, seems some tile properties aren't correct; in the very first level Keen should go behind those blue pillars.<br />In third level (IIRK) the yorp didn't fall out of the level when it fell to the flames. In original Keens they fall off the screen. You may have wrongly set tiles there or some different way of coding. But it's very small detail that doesn't matter.<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"

		"content": "Here's some small bugs that should be changed:<br />1. If Keen is jumping with pogo he can get back to opposite direction fairly easily. In the official ones it isn't that easy, and requires a long fall/jump to work.<br />2. The guard robots shoot too high. The ammo they shoot should spawn lower, as in the official games.<br />3. When Keen is frozen by an ice cannon, and if he hits and obstacle (solid tile) in air, he should drop down, and not continue the sliding again on the ground. In this game he continues sliding even if he hits something while being in the air. (I'm probably unclear, if can't see what I'm saying compare the behaviour with the official game.)<br /><br />The addition to skip parts of ending texts or such by hitting space is excellent in my opinion. However, I got something strange error in the ending that ended the game. It may be something wrong with my hardware or something, but here's the message anyways;<br /><br />abnormal program termination, error code 1/-16/-16<br />explanation: getmaptileat(): OOB reading from mapdata.<br />numplayers: 1<br /># of player instances with isPlaying set: 1<br />A fatal error has occurred; game is shutting down.<br /><br /><br />Anyways, good luck.<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"

For starters:<br />- Map movement should be a constant velocity. At the moment, Keen seems to accelerate gradually and roam around like a default racecar object in Klik &amp; Play.<br />- Currently, the in level Keen starts and stops suddenly, whereas there should be a slight deceleration when the player stops moving.<br />- Jumping is abrupt and doesn't have the right level of control. I can't quite put my finger on what's causing the problem, though.<br /><br />I haven't tested the pogo yet.<br /><br />Also, some vsync would be nice--I've noticed some slight tearing at times. It's only a minor problem though.<br /><br />This has the potential to run existing K1-3 mods--already it's easy enough to import graphics and levels. Obviously, patches for the original games are not going to be effective, but a good start would be to enable importing of tile properties. Then we can at least play XkyKeen1 on it.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-drool.gif[/img] <br /><br />With this engine as it is, you've already achieved something that so many have failed previously.

This can make some levels unplayable or harder at least.<br />*There's the third level where at the start of the level yorps are falling out at the bottom. They don't do it here, just stay on the spikes there.<br /><br />Maybe this is not the right kind of question in a Keen forum (please don't hate me) but you're making the same game as the originals.

I did make a few changes to the physics which fixes most of the other physics errors. This should be fixed for real in 8.3.<br /><br />Cheat codes were made more \"normal\".

The original game is DOS only. CloneKeen can be compiled to run on Linux, OS X, potentially even portable systems like Pocket PC. That gives those of us that don't use DOS &amp; Windows access to a great classic game, which supports both Commander Keen and these alternative platforms.<br /><br />* Modability. I've seen a few pretty cool mods, but all mods made so far are in truth limited in what is possible. A mod designed around CloneKeen wouldn't be limited by the constraints of previous mods, since all the attribute and data files are right out there in the open, editors are supplied, and the source code is available--it could be taken as far as an entirely new fangame &amp; episode, only with all the work of implementing the Keen engine already done for the designer.</i><br /><br />Thanks everyone...see ya later...

In the original, they only chased you if they were level with you and nothing was between you and him.<br /><br />Keen's bedroom light doesn't switch on and off in the end sequence.<br /><br />The butler robots always push you away, whereas in the original, if you were going the same direction as a robot, it would \"pull\" you until you were in front of it, and then proceed to push you (so basically, you could walk past it if you were going the same direction as it).<br /><br /><br /><br />Episode 3:<br /><br />Touching a Vorticon mother is lethal.  In the original, her shots would kill you but you could touch her without harm.  Also, her shots move slower than they did in the original.<br /><br />If you press the fire key the instant a baby vorticon touches you, he doesn't knock you down.  This applies even if the baby vorticon doesn't die.<br /><br />In the underground area of the Vortiville level, vorticons can walk through the crates, whereas they couldn't in the original.<br /><br />The limbs of the mangling machine kill on contact, unlike in the original.<br /><br />Keen stands in front of the clouds instead of behind them.<br /><br />After the end sequence is shown the game doesn't go to the high score table, at least not in my version.<br /><br /><br /><br />All Episodes:<br /><br />The pause key won't work.  It did work in the original.<br /><br />I learned a handy method of doing a quick jump-then-shoot in the original Keens, but it won't work in Clone Keen.  It was to press and hold CTRL, then, when you were at the right height, press ALT and release both keys.  In Clone Keen, this only works if you release CTRL first, which can sometimes be a bit tricky.<br /><br /><br /><br />Those aside, this is a great clone.  It isn't quite the first, for there have been others, such as Flash Keen, but none that I've seen have come even remotely close to this level of duplication of the original."
