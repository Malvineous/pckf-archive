The gameplay is basicly a full platformer ala Mario 64 mixed in with some point and click adventure game elements. The humor and characters are great so far too. I just bought it for my pc and even though I'm only a few hours in I can tell I'm in for a ride.Check out my blog at [url=http://spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/]spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/[/url]<br />Check out my fanfics at [url=http://www.fanfiction.net/u/680124/]fanfiction.net[/url]"

I was especially pleased that it worked properly with my gamepad (dual analog sticks). I definitely recommend using one to play it. I think I'll get the full version soon.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/YorpEye.png[/img]"
