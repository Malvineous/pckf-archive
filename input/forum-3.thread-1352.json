		"content": "Hi everyone,<br /><br />The KeenWiki is now up and running.  I only just transferred the domain across to the new server so you may or may not be able to access it for the next 24 hours, but after that you shouldn't have any trouble at all.  The \"real\" URL is:<br /><br />  [url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/] http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/[/url]<br /><br />However Grafix has kindly created a redirect you may also find helpful:<br /><br />  [url=http://wiki.commanderkeen.org] http://wiki.commanderkeen.org[/url]<br /><br />This will forward to the first URL above, but it will also accept article names - so if you're e-mailing links around, you may find something like this more explanatory:<br /><br />  [url=http://wiki.commanderkeen.org/Standard_Galactic_Alphabet] http://wiki.commanderkeen.org/Standard_Galactic_Alphabet[/url]<br /><br />It's up to you which URL you want to use.<br /><br />You will need to create an account before you can start editing pages, and I recommend on your \"user\" page you list your PCKF username (especially if you've picked a different username for the wiki.)  Feel free to link to put a link to your homepage here too!<br /><br />There's a base structure on there at the moment but this is only a guide - if you can see a better way of doing something, then by all means go ahead and do it.  If you're worried your change might be drastic, you can always discuss it here first (there are discussion pages on the wiki for this, but we'll have to wait until the wiki reaches a certain size before there will be enough people to keep an eye on those!)<br /><br />I hope everyone dives in and has some fun documenting anything and everything Keen-related!

Once this has been done, I will move things like the [url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/Index_of_Creatures]Index of Creatures[/url] so that they point to the category instead.<br /><br />One other thing - when uploading images, although .gif files are permitted please try to use .png instead if at all possible!"

		"content": ".png files should come out out smaller than .gif if you correctly save them as 4-bit images, so there shouldn't be a problem there (at any rate .png is completely open and .gif is still tarnished by the whole patent issue, so I think it would be safer to stick with the newer .png format anyway.)<br /><br />Also, on a minor formatting issue, I've noticed that when people are creating articles they are bolding the name of the article in the intro, for example on the Omegamatic page it might say:<br /><br />This is the <b>Omegamatic</b>.<br /><br />This is fine and recommended, however I've noticed it's often done like this:<br /><br />This is the '''Omegamatic'''.<br /><br />Which simply bolds the text as is.  I think it would be better to do it like this:<br /><br />This is the [[Omegamatic]].<br /><br />Since you can't link to the page you're already on, on the Omegamatic page that word would appear bold, but if the wikicode is ever copied or moved onto another page suddenly the link would become live.  If ''' was used then in this situation the text would remain bold after it was copied.<br /><br />Nothing major, but I think it could help long term maintenance using [[ ]] instead."

This is one of those things where there are always going to be arguments for doing it one way over the other, and as with most things I don't believe there's a right and a wrong, it depends on the situation.  I think this way works best for the small preview images dotted all over the wiki, which is why it has been done like this so far.<br /><br />I'm more worried about *downsizing* the level images - a .png of a full Keen level is about 120kB depending on the level, but when you click on the image to get a medium size preview the MediaWiki code resizes it to an RGB .png file which is often over 1MB.  Click on the image again to download the \"high resolution\" version and you get the 120kB 16-colour .png image..."

The wikis aren't linked though, so you will need to create another account if you want to edit pages (sorry.)<br /><br />The ModdingWiki is intended primarily to document all the file formats used by the \"classic games\" of the Keen era.  I realised while I was working on my game editor that the only place where most of these formats are documented is deep within the code of various editors all around the place (e.g. Wombat.)  I thought it would be a good idea to have a central place to document all this, so that anyone wanting to write some sort of modding utility could easily get hold of some technical docs on the file formats that a game uses.  (For an example of this, go to the [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/Jill_of_the_Jungle]Jill of the Jungle[/url] page and click on the link to the map format.)<br /><br />A second reason was to have a place where modders could go to get a list of programs that would mod specific games.  (e.g. if you fancy modding Monster Bash, eventually you'll be able to go to the Monster Bash page on the ModdingWiki and see a list of modding tools you could use.)<br /><br />So Shadow Master, seeing as you're now a coder who's released some modding tools, don't forget to drop by the ModdingWiki and document some of the file formats that your tools use [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"
