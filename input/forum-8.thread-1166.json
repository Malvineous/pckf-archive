		"content": "Uh... this is silly.  As far as I know, the way a \"/roll\" command works is to roll X number of Y-sided dice, and optionally add Z to each die's result.<br />For example, let's say I wanted to roll 3 6-sided dice, and add 1 to the result of each roll.  I'd type: <b>/roll 3 6 1</b> and the results I'd get would be three numbers, ranging from 2 to 7 (because there are 6 possible rolls on a 6-sided die, and adding 1 to each of those results in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.  Duh.)<br /><br />Your command, <b>/roll 3 1 5</b>, is kinda pointless... it's rolling three single-sided dice, and adding five to each outcome.  This will always come back as 6, 6, 6, because the ONLY possible roll on a one-sided die is 1, and adding 5 to 1 always produces 6.  :P"

The existance of this \"larger\" or \"smaller\" thing for pi, however, does not prove that pi is \"limitless\".  On the contrary, pi is not limitless.  Even though I can never tell you its exact value, neither can you ever tell me, for example, that it is equal to 3.15.  Since it is also not equal to anything greater than 3.15, we can say 3.15 forms an upper bound for it, and thus limits pi's possible values.<br /><br />Similarly, 3.14 forms a lower bound for pi, again limiting its possible values.<br /><br />Infinity and negative infinity, on the other hand, are limitless, because they are each free to enlarge in one direction.  If you claimed infinity was 300 trillion + pi, I'd claim that, since infinity was limitless, infinity should also be representable as 300 trillion + pi + 1.

Now we'll say sequence (1) sums to infinity. [Technically, we can argue otherwise, but I'm sure Xtra 'its all infinity' will be happy with this]<br /><br />But what does sequence (2) sum to? At every stage its doubble that of sequence (1), so what happens when both sequences are summed to infinity?

(Although I won't touch your other statements in the meantime, this one is definitely false.)  If you give me any integer, x, in the first list, I will simply give you 2x as its pair in the second list.<br /><br />Thus, every integer, x, in the first list has a pair in the second list, 2x.  It's pretty clear to see that no two integers in the first list, x and x', can have the same pair in the second list, 2x and 2x', unless x = x'.<br /><br />It's also easy to see that any integer in the second list has a unique pair in the first list.  Assume you give me y in the second list.  Since y is even, it is divisible by 2.  Say then, that y/2 is some integer, x.  Since x is an integer, it is in the first list.  Thus, any value you pick from the second list is paired with some value in the second list.  Now, assume we have distinct y and y' paired with the same number in the first list.  Well, that really only works if y/2 = y' / 2, or in other words, y = y'.<br /><br />Therefore, any number in the first list has a unique pair in the second (it is paired to only one, and no other number in the first list is paired to the same one), and vice versa.

Apparently, back in the day, 7 was the number of perfection, and reiterating something 3 times was similar to exemplifying it, so saying \"seven, seven, seven\" was to utter something near-prefect.  By a similar token, 6 was the number of imperfection - so close to being perfect, and yet never quite able to reach it.  Reiterating that three times leads to the number of man.<br /><br />216 was ever the more creative number, though.[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Just remember that this is the year of the elite devil.<br /><br />1337 + 666 = 2003[hr][/quote][img]http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3852/sheepsmall0sf.jpg[/img]"

The dimensionality of fractalsis based on this. There are an infinite number of 0D points in a line between 0 and 1 on the number line. the square 0,0 to 1,1 on the plane of real 2D cordinates consits of an infinite number of these 1D lines [each consisting of an infinite number of points] same goes for a cube and hyper cube.

Well, if you think of a line, it is 1D Now, we make this line complicated, so it curls around in a square pattern  over and over, so it ends up covering a lot of the surface. Still 1D? Mebbeh. Say we make the line so complex it covers every single point on a 2D plane, now that 1D line is 2D!

Half of infinity is half of infinity, and so on.<br /><br />Things break down if we don't stick to the definitions I specified at the start though.

You can see neither walls nor ceiling, nor any other objects. At your feet there is a cross. Now thats all very nice, but you want to know where you're going, so you can get back to your starting point if you get lost. So you look one way and say 'this is forward, behind is backward, and there is left and right' You don't *know* this, maybe forward was behind you, but you can't do anything until you define a few things. Now you think 'each step I take, that will be one 'step' and you set off, marking the steps on your path, going forward.<br /><br />After a while you see me, I am also moving, straight towards you, also marking off distance on the ground. When we approach you say 'I have been going forward for 400 steps.' And I reply 'But *i* have been going forward also, for 600 steps!' Which one of us is right?

		"content": "Well; infinity is harder to work with than normal numbers. For example, a square meter is 1m by 1m; while a square of infinite sides, well, it can contain all sorts of stuff depending on how you look at it.<br /><br />So while normally when we change our systems, we're not changing definitions at all. 1m or 1ft; both use the *exact* same definitions, they're just a different magnitude.<br /><br />Whereas with infinity we can do all sorts of odd stuff, and we can actually *change* our definitons. THIS can change equivalences. You've heard the math book examples? If you had a hotel with infinite rooms, all full, and an infinite number of new guests arrived? These things don't often make sense, because they use the definition 'x.infinity = infinity'<br /><br />So don't worry about it, the bottom line is you can do a lot with infinity that doesn't make sense.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img] <br /><br />yorp, infinity is actually a very simple concept.  a set is defined to be infinite if there exists a bijection (one to one function) from that set onto a proper subset of itself (proper = it can't be the same set; it has to actually be \"smaller\").    if you're not familar with any of these terms, there are more detailed and easily understandable explanations are on google.  Somehow this definition is equivalent to the intuitive one.[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Just remember that this is the year of the elite devil.<br /><br />1337 + 666 = 2003[hr][/quote][img]http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3852/sheepsmall0sf.jpg[/img]"
