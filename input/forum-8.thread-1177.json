		"content": "Hey PCKF, Im working on a new game (not keen related, but maybe a cameo) that is a remake of the classic paratrooper/Night Raid game. The difference is this one will feature a WW2 Theme with different missions and attributes of the level. I have a 3 level demo posted up and would love some feedback. The story for the game is<br /><br />\"You are a freelance agent for the allied forces. Whenever a ally is in trouble, you will be there. From D-Day to Stalingrad you will fight and defend in almost all WW2 Territorys.\" <br /><br />This 3 level demo includes the campaign in which you must protect the Malaysian President from the invading Japanese Air Force.<br /><br />EDIT: Demo Removed, Full Version with Fixes, new levels and ideas coming early July[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />[img]http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/790/nt45kc.jpg[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://img235.imageshack.us/img235/3470/nt34uq.jpg[/img]<br /><br />Please tell me what you think of the game<br />No its not made in KNP[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-offended.gif[/img]    <br /><br /><br />Edit: whoops forgot the link"
