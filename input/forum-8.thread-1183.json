[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br />He's probably referring to Keen's walking sound.<br /><br />Hmmm, one of those 2 sites is screwy.<br />The first time I got an \"Error 550 (or something), unable to open directory\" or something along those lines.<br />(It's a pop-up dialog box, and according to [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes]Wikipedia[/url] 505 nor any other is status code is about that error, so I'm not sure what the fault is exactly.)<br />Anyway, after that, my Firefox told me I could send an error report and closed on me.<br />No problem after I retried right after that, but just now after opening those 2 sites Fx gave me the error again and hung on every link I tried to click.<br />Closing Fx completely didn't really close the session, so I had to force it closed.<br />Oh well!Retodon8<br />Sheep happens!
