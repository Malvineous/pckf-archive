There is some 1337 art by DivoKeen [and Djaser, and some by me too] Djaser also helped translate, so if there's any problems or offensive words, its his fault.<br /><br />It may be possible that you can't complete the mod on your computer, if this is the case, run error.Bat; this will finnish the mod when you complete any level.<br /><br />Do tell me how it is, problems and etc!<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br />I didn't want to comment until I got far enough to say something informed, but if you must know, I like it a lot. I especially like the tileset. I'm not really wild about the Aliens theme, but it's a good solid mod. It's fun how the levels feel deep underground.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/toughyorp.png[/img]"
