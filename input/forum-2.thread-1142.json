So I wanted to make a forum where fangame builders could settle down and help each other out, and give eachother much needed morale boosts when something is getting to them.<br /><br />I was wondering how many people would be interested in joining an fangame only forum.  The forum would exist to help fangame makers get their games done.<br /><br />It would basically have a links to useful resources, to a place to show off the latest things you've done with your fangames, to asking advice on programming.<br /><br />I've go the forum created.. I just need to figure out how to work the damn thing, so until then, I'm just giving everyone a head's up.<br /><br /><br />The people who I think may be interested are:<br /><br />Damien SR<br />Joe Capricorn<br />Shadow Master<br />Apocalypse Gohan<br />Afgncaaps<br />Vitamin Zach<br />Lititude<br />z hyphen one<br />szevvy<br />Too Much Time to Spare<br />Zero Diamond<br />Lava89<br />MortimerinBlack<br />Malvineous<br />freeyorp101<br />duke4e<br />lv4n<br />Commander Spleen<br />Genious314<br />DSL<br />Q90<br /><br /><br />I realize I could have some modders mixed up with fangamers, but this is a potential list of viable members.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

I don't think the forum format is really suited for anything much beyond that.<br /><br />I think that if you start a new forum you'll get a few enthusiastic people joining, but you have to keep in mind that enthusiasm doesn't necessarily equal knowledge.  I mean - picking someone at random - you could argue that Szevvy knows his stuff when it comes to game formats, but the time between his posts is measured in weeks at best.  If you want that experience, you won't get it quickly.<br /><br /><i>getting a new account isn't exactly time consuming if you want to get the help</i><br /><br />True, but do you really want a forum full of people needing help and nobody who knows any answers to the questions?  When you're looking for help yourself, the last thing you want to look through is other people's unanswered questions...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, if you think it deserves a forum on its own then by all means set one up and see what happens - I just think you'll have a bit of trouble convincing people why they should join another forum that has quite a bit of overlap with one they're already part of."
