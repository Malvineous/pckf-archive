		"content": "We all know Commander Keen just isn't that popular these days. Why? Simple; it's not reaching the younger generation, today's kids, who follow trends and fads much different from those around when Keen was created.<br /><br />The solution? We need a more 'hip' more 'cool' Keen that appeals to the kids of today. As such, I, with some help from TMST. (I was management, he was labor, I made the decisions, he just did everything.) provide for your scrutiny some concept art for the new Commander Keen series to be released this august: Commander Kizzeen 7: Pimp my Galaxy<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet.png[/img]<br /><br />First up, the Gargs need more 'bling bling' We call this the 'KeenRush' style.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet1.png[/img]<br /><br />Yorps have their own look, modeled after recent Yorp rap celebrity, Smeeg.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet2.png[/img]<br /><br />Quote from the game: 'Thanks for pullin' mah a$$ outta dis shizz! time i was gettin' down wit' da o-chamber!'<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet3.png[/img]<br /><br />This character will feature in a whole new level, The Pyramid of the Pimpsticene Ancients.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet4.png[/img]<br /><br />Combining both rap and Rock n' Roll.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet5.png[/img]<br /><br />This guy's a *real* dope fish!<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet6.png[/img]<br /><br />The sprites rock hard with their white trash beatz, singing with the mullets &amp; whatnot in the lake.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet7.png[/img]<br /><br />Slime Sluggy-slug, since the Vorticons refused to have anything to do with either Snoopy or dogs.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet8.png[/img]<br /><br />Kizzeen hisself.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet9.png[/img]<br /><br />Mad mushrooms, actually, this is what I always imagined Commander Spleen to look like.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet10.png[/img]<br /><br />Some characters of course, were abandoned.<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/skeet11.png[/img]<br /><br />M.C.
