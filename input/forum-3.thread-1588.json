Not sure how I'll feel about it after I've listened to it 500 times, but right now I really like it. Thanks for pointing it out. The lyrics bit is cool, too.--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"

OCR and VGMix are the only two major remix sites out there, and I highly doubt that there are any underground Keen music sites hiding somewhere. Every so often one will pop up on OCR's Works in Progress board, and I've managed to scavenge a couple from it, though they aren't as quality as the others. There's also my old banjo and fiddle one which should never be mentioned again."

Unfortunately the remixes in this particular album (or at least the Keen and Doom II ones I recognise) don't really seem to be remixes - they sound too much like the original songs with different instruments.  I much prefer it when the songs sound completely different, like most of the other songs in this thread."
