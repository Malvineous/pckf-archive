(This goes for <i>everyone</i>... we used to have an issue with LL and Unfleexable having 'signature wars' which mucked up the entire community for a while.) (Also, keep in mind, I'm not an admin or moderator or anything--I'm just offering my opinion.)<br /><br />For example, in this thread, on my screen, each of your posts only takes up a single line, which is about a dozen pixels tall... but then your signature comes right after, and is nearly 180 pixels tall.  That's over 10 extra lines worth of text!<br /><br />Let's say there's a longer discussion thread going on--like the thread LevelLord00 started about Points in the Keen games.  If you decide to go in there and write up a longer post about why you think things are the way they are, then sure--tack your signature on at the bottom.  <br /><br />But if your post is only four words and one smile-face long, (like this last one,) you may want to un-check the \"Include custom signature.\" checkbox right above the \"Add Reply\" button.<br /><br />Don't worry about it so much--we know you're new here.  We're just tryin' to help you settle down a little so that you don't get in trouble.  ;-)[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"
