When I went to the cinema I really didn't expect the movie to be above average Hollywood action movie. Thankfully I was proven wrong. The story was a lot deeper than usually, and wasn't that traditional either. It was also nice to see the main characters not ending up in the same bed as usually seems to happen. I recommend this movie to everyone.

I through up. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img] <br /><br />So thats kind of putting me off for the moment.  I do kind of want to see it though, because it does look sort of interesting and maybe they can pull off again what they accomplished with The Matrix.[img]http://www.denness.net/rpi/username/mr12000[/img]"
