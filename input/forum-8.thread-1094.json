		"content": "is my departure<br /><br />Yes, theres nothing wrong with your eyes this is indeed a goodbye topic. Everyone with two posts or more has one, so why cant I?<br /><br />The last time I became more and more frustrated with the laziness of the Keen community. The Keen 1 level pushed it to the limit and I decided to leave. Not wishing to rush my dissension I waited a while and what day was more suited than 3-14? I dont really have a problem with specific people, although there are some people who wouldnt want to meet me in real life. What bugs me is the attitude that nobody wants to anything and are just covering it up with bad excuses. The passive attitude when something actually happens doesnt really help. I know that I didnt complete to many projects in the years that Ive been here but like I said its nothing personal and I admit my own guilt. But if we could expect a lot Keen activity this year than I would stay, however a maximum of level contests doesnt really excites me. The laziness topic shows that hope is vain. So what reasons gives us that to exist? I cant think of one and drew my conclusions. If the community flourish again in about a year, I might as well return but for the time being I have to move.<br /><br />eagerly awaiting the two replies before this topic drops to the bottom,<br /><br />Holy Djaser"

If you want a zillion responses every time you mod a tile or two, you really are in the wrong forum - like Spleen says, I too enjoy the community atmosphere here, and it doesn't bother me in the slightest that things happen slowly.<br /><br />Maybe you should try the 3DRealms forum instead?

I'll be missing your wit, and such. Hopefully you'll come back later. However, I can't exactly understand why you're leaving. Yes, I read that about laziness and such, but can't understand why it frustrates you so much you can't post in the forums. Anyways, good luck.
