Glad to hear you're making money.  I believe in the US, you need to be at least 16 to get a job, though many companies in my area won't hire a person unless they're 18.  All the under 18's have to work for fast food or grocery stores.  Yuck!<br /><br />My first job was at the community college I attended, monitoring a computer music laboratory--it was a rediculously easy job.  Basically I got paid minimum wage ($6.75/hour in California) to browse the internet and make sure everyone knew how to use File--Save As and File--Open on their machines.  :-D  Cake!<br /><br />Currently I'm working for a racquetball company, doing data entry and some phone work regarding their sponsored player program.  It's similarly easy, though there are a few more guidelines which didn't exist with the college--of course, the pay is much better, as well (nearly double my previous hourly rate!)  <br /><br />I hope your new job serves you well--and I'm sure any future boyfriends will be thankful you ride your bike so far each day.  I should do something like that; I've put on a couple pounds since high school.  But in order to do that, I'd need more free time--and that's just not working out for me *glances at dusty XkyKeen4 folder*  :-("
