A website I've had in the works for nearly a year. Its main purpose is to provide a summary of the interesting things that happen in the Keen community, particularly the PCKF and K:M, filling the gaps left by existing sites.<br /><br />My hope is that it makes things easier for Keen fans who may not have the time to keep up with the forums, as well as non-Keeners who are curious about what we're up to but don't want to wade through hundreds of posts to find the stuff that interests them.<br /><br />The 'Teleporter' link column on the left will also help us keep track of the myriad Keen sites scattered about the Interweb. See [url=http://p098.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumother.showMessage?topicID=2557.topic]this topic[/url] if you can contribute some link images. I'm adhering to an 88x31 link button system to keep things neat and interesting.<br /><br />I've given administrative powers to KeenRush and Grafix, two Keeners whom I trust implicitly. Their task is to extract news from the PCKF and Keen:Modding as it comes up, and generally keep things running smoothly. Hopefully they'll have enough time between them to ensure regular updates, but I may be needing one more yet. I'm leaving for a two-week holiday in two days, so I'm interested to see how self-sufficient it can be.<br /><br />There is a discussion [url=http://p098.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumother.showMessage?topicID=2556.topic]here[/url] asking what you all consider news. It would be helpful to hear some more feedback there, but I'm sure over time it should become self-evident.<br /><br />I don't know for sure what to expect of this site yet, though there's a lot more I plan to do with it. Do let me know what could do with improvement, or other features you'd like to see down the track.<br /><br />Above all, enjoy!"
