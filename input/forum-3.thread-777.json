I was hoping that someone will restore all old topics in this forum and it's probably possible now!<br />More detais: the unneeded deleting of topics have started much ealier than May 31, 2005! After the 20th page was filled the forum started deleting of most old topics (in the down of 20-th page). I have noticed it in June 2004. It seems that number or pages is limited to 20. <br />We have totally more than 20 pages of losed topics. So you can't save all those threads on this forum. For this purpose, make please new site for which doesn't erase any information automatically.<br />Anyway, i want to have old threads again.<br />I wish you lucky restoration process.<br />[img]http://classicgaming.com/cc314/encyclopedia/images/enemyk4-wormouth.gif[/img]"

		"content": "I now found the other way to restore threads: use the saved ones. Yesterday i have reviewed all my saved files and found approximaly 50-55 threads from the forum \"Official Keen Games\"! Total number of disappeared threads in that forum is approximaly 820, so i made approximaly 1/16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of the work. Other forums weren't \"restored\", because i practically don't have saved threads from them. <br />People! Please help me, if you can. Find any threads from this forum on  your computer, pack them into ZIP or RAR archive (without the folders, which contains images from page: &lt;Filename&gt;_Files, where &lt;Filename&gt; is a name of page without extnension (.htm or .html)) and send them to me. My e-mail is: drm1991@mail.ru. MHT files also fits for me.<br /><br />If you used the default filenames, you can easily find them. Open the standard searching utilite (\"Start - Search - Files or folders\"), and input the filename \"*ezboard*\". Unfortanutely, it doesn't work, if you used the Internet explorer 4.0 or older, because in these browsers you have to input your filename during each save.<br /><br />If you can, you may also:<br /> Select the best (slowest) compression ratio in the archiver. I have slow internet, so it's very actual. Size of mailbox is also not infinite.<br /> Pack also the images that were posted (i.e presents in posts)<br /> Split your archives into a volumes not more than 1 Megabyte. This function is also available in a archiver (WinZip or WinRar).<br /><br />Thank you very much for any help. If you send me saved threads i'll be able to restore this forum and send the result to someone, who can upload it! So yo'll help many people, who want to see old threads again, not just me.<br />[img]http://classicgaming.com/cc314/encyclopedia/images/enemyk4-wormouth.gif[/img]"
