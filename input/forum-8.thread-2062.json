Its been fun, discussing keen and getting to know several of you personally, and I honestly never thought that my time to leave would ever come.  But it has, so its goodbye.  <br /><br />Before I leave however, Id like to get all my unfinished Keen projects and miscellaneous Keen art out for others to use.  If someone could host the file for me, just contact me on msn and Ill send it on over and get it posted in this topic."
