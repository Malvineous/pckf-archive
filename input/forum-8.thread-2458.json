It was quite fun to see first the amount of articles being under million, refreshing the page and seeing the value having increased and being over one million. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  I'm talking about the English Wikipedia, to mention. (Not that anybody cares about the other language versions..)<br /><br />Here's the millionth article:<br />[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanhill_railway_station]en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jor...ay_station[/url]<br /><br />Cool.3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be. I <b>don't consider</b> that GBA game canon by any means.\""

By the 125000th century, the number had finally passed a million, and there was much celebration and rejoicing.<br /><br />But, in the years after, the world's generations began to wonder what point remained in Keen mods, now that people had devoted their entire lives to them.  They slowly came to realize that the world's intellect had been spent on playing console games, and never would Keen grow beyond a console game, now that ID Software had failed to come out with 'The Universe is Toast'.  Now, it seemed there was nothing else to live for.\"<br /><br />\"And humanity became extinct?  Just like that?  You expect me to believe this?\"<br /><br />\"No...not just like that.  It took many tens of thousands of centuries, and there were periods of ups and downs.  But the world seemed to lose passion, its will to live...  No longer would this great game progress anywhere, or would we see any more of its light, for it had exhausted it all... Until, finally, there was a sharp decline in births, and we died out!\"[hr][/quote]<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]The end of eternity shall be marked by the completion of \"The Universe is Toast.\" -Anonymous[hr][/quote]"
