Since Keeners will be using a batch file to start the game anyway, you could just let them choose then. Have two patches; one for two button and one for space.<br /><br />Something like this would do the trick. It would be nice to use only one options file, but environment variables are broken in DOSbox, necessitating a workaround.<br />[pre] @ECHO OFFIF \"%1\"==\"/c\" GOTO :MAKEOPTSIF \"%1\"==\"/C\" GOTO :MAKEOPTSIF EXIST SPACEFIR.DAT GOTO STARTSPCIF EXIST CTALTFIR.DAT GOTO STARTTWO:MAKEOPTSECHO Preparing to start YOUR-MOD....ECHO Would you like to fire with (C)ontrol and Alt or (S)pace?CHOICE /C:CS /N (\"CKSELECT /C\" to choose again)IF ERRORLEVEL == 2 GOTO STARTSPCIF ERRORLEVEL == 1 GOTO STARTTWO:STARTSPCECHO Starting MOD-NAME using space to fire....ECHO TRUE &gt; SPACEFIR.DATIF EXIST CTALTFIR.DAT DEL CTALTFIR.DATCK1PATCH MODSPACE.PATGOTO END:STARTTWOECHO Starting MOD-NAME with two-button firing....ECHO TRUE &gt; CTALTFIR.DATIF EXIST SPACEFIR.DAT DEL SPACEFIR.DATCK1PATCH MODCTALT.PATGOTO END:END[/pre]________________<br />[img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8498/missouriansf9.png[/img]"
