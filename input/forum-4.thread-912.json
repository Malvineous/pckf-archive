If you want a different folder, go up to the level where your folder is an icon. open the 'run' diolouge box in the start menu, and drag the icon of your folder onto the run box. It will give you the path to your folder. [remove the - \"\"])<br /><br />5) Type, \"modkeen -episode=1 -export\"<br /><br />6) Press enter<br /><br />7) Now modkeen should copy the graphics from keen into the folder<br /><br />8 )  Now, you can edit these pictures. When you are done, repeate the proscess, and instead type, \"modkeen -episode=1 -import\"<br /><br /><br />Or... *gasps for breath!!!*:<br /><br />1) Go to your start menu, and choose:<br />   a)Programs<br />   b)Accesories<br />   c)Notepad<br /><br />2) Enter, \"modkeen -episode=1 -export\"<br /><br />3) Choose \"Save As\"<br /><br />4) When you are in the save box, go to the Modkeen folder, and save as \"Import.bat\"<br /><br />5) Go to your Modkeen folder, and click on the batch file (Import.bat)<br /><br />6) Now the graphics should be copyed<br /><br />7) Right click on the 'Import.bat' and choose 'edit'<br /><br />8 )  change the text to, \"modkeen -episode=1 -import\"<br /><br />9) Save<br /><br />10) Now, whenever you want to import, and test your new graphics, double-click on the 'Import.bat\"<br /><br />That's what I use.<br /><br />Now I'm tired of typing, and will end this post...
