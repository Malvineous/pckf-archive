		"content": "In Commander Keen 5, there exist a terrible yet slighty strange secret, many people, including me have seen how pure evil it can be.<br /><br />This is a shelley.<br /><br />[img]http://dosclassics.com/keen/images/ck5/creatures/shelley.gif[/img]<br /><br />When hit by Shelley's shrapnel as you pass through a door, the background allows you to walk inward, there is usually an invisible icon assigning the destination's hex value,  or the value for clearing the stage.<br /><br />The one exception is the Korath III teleporter, which has no value, so when you walk through a door and your destination becomes unclear (to the game) due to being pushed by something, you are usually dumped off at Korath III.<br /><br />For a short time I thought it was the only way to get to the Korath III level.<br /><br />Many experiments involving Shelley shrapnel have ended up with people dumped out in the space portion of the Armageddon Machine map, others simply \"win\" the level and some have claimed that it can make accessing the elevator impossible.<br /><br />The final possible result Pleinair123 has confirmed: a RF error that will not only crash the game, but may cause your PC to lock up.<br /><br />To sum things up, it has the chance of screwing your game over, and has a very unlikely but very disturbing chance of screwing the player over outside of the game itself, these door glitches are just more of a luck of the draw, so beware the next time you walk through a door with a shelley.<br /><br />[hr]<br /><center>KEEN</center><br />[center] [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopekeen.gif[/img]       [/center]<br /><center>DOPE</center>"
