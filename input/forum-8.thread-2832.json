Is there a tutorial for making a game with this (with levels, shooting, etc.)?<br />2. I cant get the camera to start at a certain position.<br />3. How do i make \".x\" 3D files?<br />4. Does anyone have the code for a 3d game in Dark Basic that i can edit to use? (i like to edit existing codes to learn how to program. is this not a good way to learn?)<br />5. I only have 28 days left before i have to buy it [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br />6. this will be <i>another</i> Keen 3d IF i can make a good engine with it.[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v609/genius314/picturekeen.bmp[/img]"

With some 3D modelling software. I can't model 3D at all.. Basically just make the model and save it in .x format.<br />4. Heh, this is quite much to ask. I guess nobody here has one. As well, if you've never done any 3D stuff and never touched Dark Basic, it can be a quite hard to just make up a 3D engine or realize how something ready-made works. Even in a language like this, where 3D stuff handling has been purposefully made 'easy', it can be thousands of lines of code.<br />5. If you really want to use it then probably the only way is to buy it. If it's good it's worth the money. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br />6. Sure..

		"content": "thats what I do, DarkBASIC is fun and easy to me<br /> here are some basic types of data from the book:<br /><br />*INTEGER NUMBERS<br />An integer number can hold a whole number,                                                                                                                                                                                      but no fraction.for the value to be negative, you must not use commas as part of the the number as this would genarate a SYNTAX Error. examples of integer numbers:<br /><br />42<br />10000<br />-233000<br />-100<br /><br />*REAL NUMBERS<br />A real number can hold a whole number or a fractional number that uses a decimal point.For the value to be negative, you must place a hyphen symbol (-) before the value. Examples of real numbers:<br /><br />20.0005<br />99.9<br />-5000.12<br />-9999.9991<br /><br />hope I was some help [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

Why go through the calculation of falling and THEN check, wouldn't you put the check first. If you are on the ground it would make you fall, do the check, and then UNDO what was just done. And wouldn't that just make the player bob up and down? I mean you are checking anyway so by putting the check first it should just make your program faster.<br /><br />for example:<br /><br />Check<br />       Not on ground<br />             Fall<br /><br />Check<br />       On ground<br />(Hmm EzBoard messed up my nice \"Tabbing\" I had here)<br /><br />No undo needed.-----------------------<br />\"The Adventures of Commander Keen\" issue #1: coming soon."
