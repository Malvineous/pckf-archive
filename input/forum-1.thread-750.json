(Not KeenWright, I mean the REALLY old one that doesn't work very well. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-oldy.gif[/img] )  I don't know if that's what they used...I actually highly doubt it, now that I think about it, since the Keen Editor doesn't seem to work with any episode except for Keen 1.
