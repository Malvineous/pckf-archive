		"content": "Here are some friendly hints I found out that will help you.<br /><br />When posting pictures don't FORCE someone to download it. Instead of using the image ez code use the link.<br /><br />For example, when posting an image don't do this:<br />[img]http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/7475/bleegdavatar60pxl7lp.png[/img]<br /><br />But do this.<br /><br />[img]http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/7475/bleegdavatar60pxl7lp.png[/img]<br /><br />One other thing is how big to resize the image? I found a really nice trick for this that makes the images a great size. In Photoshop (At 1024x768 resolution, because that is the standard.) click on the \"Zoom\" tool and click \"Fit on screen.\" This will zoom the image to where the entire picture can be seen at once. Look over to what percent the picture is at and then at the top menu click on \"Image -&gt; Image size\" This will open up a box with the height and width and a few other unimportant things on it. On either the height and width click the drop down   box on the units and switch it to percent. Then simply type in the percent that fits on the screen and click ok. Now your image is resized to a good size for the web.<br /><br />Makes people more happy. Also don't use .bmp OR .jpg. The compression algorithm for JPEG is made for PHOTOS and not scanned art. Using JPEG compression will just artifact your drawings so don't EVER EVER use the .jpg format for drawings. EVER.<br /><br />ALSO if you do not have any color in a picture, you can (in Photoshop at least) switch the mode to grayscale and save as a PNG. This will make it MUCH smaller than saving it in RGB format and is the smallest and best format for black and white drawings I have found. Saving a greyscale PNG is even smaller than a GIF and it is the same quality.<br /><br />But as with any form of compression, there are better things for each and every situation. This is why Photoshop has \"Save for web\" in the file menu. It lets you preview how an image will look in different formats with different options. The best recommendation is to go here and just mess around until you get a good filesize/look.<br /><br />Hope you understood everything and that it will help you. Good luck on your art thread. I know I don't have the guts to make an art thread.

I suspect the reason LL was complaining is because your picture was 5MB and on dialup that can take rather a long time to download.  If you'd converted it to PNG or JPG, it would've only taken a minute or two...but it's up to you whether you want people to look at your pictures or not - if you make it too difficult (like using BMP) we just won't bother [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mort.gif[/img]"
