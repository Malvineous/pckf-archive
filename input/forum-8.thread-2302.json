This includes things like newtons apple tree, that there are 7 colors in a rainbow [indigo was added to make it the lucky number 7] and that you'd explode in a vacum.<br /><br />Until now pluto was viewed as a planet, a bit odd yes, indeed the oddball of the solar system, but a planet nonetheless. Now it is one among many bodies,a bit of solar derbis n the outside of the system. This has had an impact, otherwise why would there be all that media attention, something cherished that we learnt in our youth has been changed.<br /><br />Now the focus has shifted to the kupier belt as a whole. Public perception of the solar system has been shifted. It will take a few years for it to be fully accepted, but eventually it should sink into the relm of popular science and impact the way we look at our local part of space. It may not be as influential as say the discovery of an anticancer drug, but it'll have more awareness.<br />Szevvy Forever!<br />And Spleen never!<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
