		"content": "1.) The Keen engine is trying to keep track of where Keen is on the map. When you use the jump cheat the normal safeguard in the level is unable to cope and does a doubble take, causing this interesting little effect. Crystalus is another example of when the engine can't cope.<br /><br />2.) Andrew, Xtra, me and Najawa will host them without question.

If you use Jump-cheat and No-clipping and then jump up you will see the whole main (big) part of this level!<br />If you save the game here and then load it, you can see the bottom tiles \"Edge of map\" and even some strange things behind the game-field.[img]http://classicgaming.com/cc314/encyclopedia/images/enemyk4-wormouth.gif[/img]"
