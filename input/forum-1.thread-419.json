What kind of things would you like to see <b>added</b> or <b>changed</b> from the game (or levels) in order for it to be better (<b>visually</b>).<br /><br />Use this thread to also talk about how levels could be modified in order for areas inside them to be more realisticlly meaningfull.<br /><i><br />e.g. Theres a corridor with no significance, its there because it just is. What could this 'corridor' in the level be turned into to make it seem like its there for a reason?</i><br /><br />Some suggestions could be for iDSoftware to:<br />* Add depth to the levels (i.e. a foreground, background)<br />* Rain<br />* Night levels<br />* Green floor in keen 5 should be metalic and have reflections<br />* Dirt floor tile in keen 4 should be grass<br />* Empty room could be turned into a surveillance room with monitors<br /><br />Some ideas may be hard to explain and so a sketch like this may come in handy:<br /><br />Windows in the walls of the pyramids with light seeping through<br /><br />[img]http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/1034/minordetailow2.jpg[/img]<br /><br />If you can think of a more appropriate texture for a certain wall please draw or explain what it should look like.<br /><br />Discuss!"

Look at levels in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, or Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped for instance... they are essentially 2d games, done with 3d graphics.  I would ADORE a Keengame done in this manner, even if it was a straight re-make/re-realization of Keen4, which is my least-favorite Keen.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />Ultimately, though, if you're going to up the graphics you're going to have to up the animation, also.

IIRK it's called CloneKeen. There are many discrepencies in the controls and physics and such, but it's at least completely playable and has some support for mods (I know it works with XkyKeen1 at least)."
