Not easy for someone with little patience and a bad mouse...<br /><br />Anyway, it's interesting to see the entire levels in a single shot. Like Xky said, I alway imaginged the levels were bigger than they actually are. Well, now I know. Good job, again.[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"
