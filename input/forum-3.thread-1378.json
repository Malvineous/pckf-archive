After reading a bunch of strips, I sent KeenRush there, whereupon he noticed [url=http://nerd-boy.net/nbbrowse.php?beg=311&end=320#314]this[/url].<br /><br />I sent the following email to Joaquim Gndara, Nerd Boy's creator:<br />[hr]<b>Spleen</b> Do I smell an extremely subtle reference to Commander Keen? Or am I an idiot reading too much into things again?[hr]<br />To which he replied:<br />[hr]<b>JG</b> Since I have played those games, I thought you might have stumbled upon some reference that -- unbeknowst to even myself -- had sneaked its way into a strip. Looking at the strip, I can't find anything that suggests a Commander Keen reference. The only way I can read it is as I intended it; Nerd Boy is smart, and Fan Boy is stupid. What was your interpretation?[hr]<br />I explained:<br />[hr]<b>Spleen</b> Commander Keen's IQ is 314, so it's an interesting fluke that Episode 314 happens to feature IQ as its theme. We Keeners are always on the lookout for occurances of 314, regardless of their inherent meaning. Here's another to add to the list.<br />[hr]<br />So, there we have a random unwitting Keen reference to add to our collection. Apparently I'm an idiot reading too much into things again. Hooray!<br /><br />Hehe, Nerd Boy rocks.<br /><br />And a final reply on the topic:<br />[hr]<b>JG</b> Whooo, that's actually pretty awesome! Of course, now I wish I'd googled<br />\"keen 314\" before I replied just so I could've pretended it was on purpose.<br />Blast!<br /><br />Glad you like the strips.

Well the last paragraph in that section used to state this.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]The BFG in the Doom movie is identified, on a computer monitor, as \"Bio Force Gun version 3.14\". The number is possibly in reference to the games [the 3] and Section 14 of Tom Hall's original Doom design document [the .14] (it also could just be the number pi). Unlike in the video games, the gun is not labeled as '9000'.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />Woah woah wait wait wait ...<br />let me quote that again... <br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]The number is possibly in reference to the games [the 3] and Section 14 of Tom Hall's original Doom design document [the .14][hr][/quote]<br />Oh so it has NO reference to Tom Hall's earlier creation known to the world as \"Commander Keen?\"<br />Honestly that is a bigger stretch than what some of YOU posted in this thread. And you guys are pretty bad.<br /><br />I took on the liberty of rectifying this.<br />It now reads:<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]The BFG in the Doom movie is identified, on a computer monitor, as \"Bio Force Gun version 3.14\". The number is most likely a reference to one of Tom Hall's earliest computer game creations, Commander Keen, who's intelligence quotient is at 314. It has also been speculated that the number is a reference to the number of Doom games [the 3] and Section 14 of Tom Hall's original Doom design document [the .14] (Though it also could just be the number pi). Unlike in the video games, the gun is not labeled as '9000'.[hr][/quote]<br />(Stupid Doom fanboys... [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-furious.gif[/img] )<br /><br />ANYWAY...<br /><br />I know TMST put it in Strife Toons ep.1 (WHERE IS EPISODE 3 SLUGGY?!) But since it cropped up I guess I should say it again here. Yes in the Doom movie (Which I never saw mind you.) there is the BFG 314.-----------------------<br />The end of this post.

If you don't know these series, you may try them and [url=http://www.mysterycasefiles.com/]check out the site[/url]. They are very addictive and very well done.<br /><br />The upper image was taken from MCF: Ravenhearst (the third from the series). Notice the helmet? You'll say \"It's just an ordinary helmet. And it's not even yellow!\". <br /><br />Ok, nothing special here? Wait for this:<br />[img]http://img483.imageshack.us/img483/8350/snap193ox1.jpg[/img]<br /><br />Coincidence? I think not! It's obvious that the authors of the Mystery Case Files series are Commander Keen lovers. And when I saw this I was \"WOW!\"<br /><br />Furthermore, I've noticed one yellow helmet (a suspiciously Keen looking one) in MCF: Huntsville. I've noticed it long before the other two games came out, but wasn't sure to post it here or not. I believe there is one more helmet in this game, but I don't remember well.<br /><br />Also, there is one Keen reference in MCF: Prime Suspects too. <br /><br />I'm unable to go to their locations and take screenshots to show you because I have to start playing these games from the beginning. And this takes a loong time.<br /><br />So I truly believe the authors are Commander Keen fans [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  . And I was thinking of asking them if they really mean these as a Keen references.----<br /><br />[img]http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/1923/untitled116qa.gif[/img]<br />Tough Bloogs eat princesses"
