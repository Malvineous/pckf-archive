Letters, as written, could mean all kinds of things. If we're talking about phonetics, we'd better use \"canonical pronunciations\", or we're getting nowhere. \"A\" has four reasonable meanings (I'm basing this on my dictionary), but a schwa is not usually one of them.________________<br />[img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8498/missouriansf9.png[/img]"

It's cool that way.<br /><br />Shockshund, I pronounced for the longest time like Shock-shund.  I'm amazed by how long it took me to figure out that it's a play on Dachshund.

Some, such as Shelley you would expect to be both genders (Although asexual all female populations are possible.) Whereas with others like Robo Red gender is unlikely and you can  ascribe any one you want.<br /><br />A similar problem occured with Death in the Discworld series by Pratchett, Death was originally nongendered and thus was translated freeley as either male or female depending on the tradition of that language (I believe in Spanish death is traditionally female?) but later books revealed he was male and things had to be changed.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]One Shikadi, many Shikadi, I'd say.<br /><br />Like Pokmon.

Here tradition is mixed, races can have plurals or not (1 Vorticon, 2 Vorticons vs 'the Vorticon homeworld' not 'The Vorticon's homeworld' either makes sense ad I personally think that yes, it's like Pokmon. We should ask Tom hall, along with the Smirky question.[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Awww! Feel the love!"
