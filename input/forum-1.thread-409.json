Most often (I think) it worked via running a TSR (Terminate, Stay Resident... i.e. a \"background\" program), which would not actually change the exe, but would \"interact\" with it once it got to the copy protection portion.  However, I think it also sometimes simply patched the .exe itself."

Is that normal?[hr][/quote]<br />If you check your Keen 6 directory, you will notice that you have two executable files Keen6.com and Keen6.exe. Keen6.exe is the actual Keen executable while Keen6.com is a small loader file which will load a patch into memory, then run Keen6.exe. The purpose of the patch is to bypass the Keen 6 \"enemy identification\" screen.<br /><br />Because of DOS' precedence rules, if you type just \"keen6\", it's the COM file that is run, thus invoking the patch. If you explicitly type \"keen6.exe\", the game will start without the patch and you'll notice that you will be asked to identify an enemy when starting or loading a game."

There's also a ridiculously long 'level loading' time.<br /><br />Edit: When I ran Keen6.exe, it did run without the patch, but the patch seemed to make it run more smoothly overall (discounting the initial speed jump).[img]http://www.angelfire.lycos.com/mech/roboblue/Robo_Blue.gif[/img] [url=http://www.angelfire.lycos.com/mech/roboblue]Official Keenbound Site[/url]<br />Visit [url=http://tdvmsgboard.conforums.com/index.cgi/]The Dos Vault Message Board[/url].

It's unlikely that ALL of the Keen Dreams music was finished before softdisk informed them of the space requirement.

He was in his back yard with his pogo stick and would jump on the slugs to squish them.  He went down a hole and would do the same.  I believe he went to the pyramids and a mine and under the ocean.  These are the only scenarios I remember from this versin of the game.<br /><br />Can somebody please tell me the name of that game and version.  I just do not recall and I think I am lookin in the wrong area.<br /><br />Please email me at:  georgeph38@yahoo.com  <br /><br />I would greatly appreciate this.<br /><br />Thank you in advance,<br /><br />George!"

However, there are oversized mosquitoes, called Skypests, which can be squished.<br /><br />The game doesn't actually take place in Billy's back yard, but the scene shows up in the Star Wars style story screen during the demo sequence.<br /><br />Finally, there are indeed pyramids and an underwater level (though it's not until a bit later in the game that you can reach it).
