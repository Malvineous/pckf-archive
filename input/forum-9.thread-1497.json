Approximately 15% of *all* net traffic isn't actually sent from the web server, but instead from a company that stores a large part of the net on its servers. [When there is congestion on the net this company is contacted instead and sends you the page uicker than it would when routed from the companies server. Goggle, CNN and microsoft are all customers] Also web servers already block packages [spam and malign code] and prioritize certain data packets, [such as video feed] that needs to be timely. Equality here could be harmful for everyone.<br /><br />So, should we have an 'equal' net? Or should the infrastructure providers be able t prioritize?<br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

The only thing they could do is put \"Tiers\" on the stuff within the US.[hr][/quote]<br />It's not that the US wants to legislate a tiered Internet into being; the ISPs themselves want tiers so they can charge people they have no business charging. Everyone pays their ISP for access: from you and me all the way up to Google everyone on the Internet is paying for it. Now some ISPs want to charge people for simply sending traffic through their networks from the network of their provider.<br /><br />The controversy in the US is over whether there should be laws against charging a fee for better quality-of-service. These will, of course have no effect in other countries. I'm not even sure if it's an issue outside the US, as the possibility of charging fees for decent service depends on regulations. Anyone living where the laws permit it should be very worried.________________<br />[img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8498/missouriansf9.png[/img]"
