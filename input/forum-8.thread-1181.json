It would take a little while to show up. Google would need to crawl back around the internet and scan this page again.<br /><br />And I remember how I found the PCKF...<br /><br />Actually... no... I don't remember how I found it... but I DO remember that I found it by a roundabout way. I found Glen Rhoads Commander Keen flash game and I started searching around for Commander Keen stuff. Then I stumbled on this but that was only after I found many dead \"Ultimate Fan Pages\" that haven't been updated since 97'. I was *CONVINCED* that Commander Keen was dead and that I was the only fan left alive. (Ok so not <i>that</i> drastic but still.)<br /><br />Djaser is right. Unless someone does some hardcore digging on Commander Keen all they see is a dead fan base. I know. I thought that for years.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/New-blegd-smeeg-banner-60.png[/img][/url]"
