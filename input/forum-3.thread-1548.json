		"content": "Woah it's been along time since i've posted here, i've ocasionally looked around the forums every couple of months but it's been about two years since i last posted something.<br /><br />Anyway, while i was an active member i built a site called [url=http://www.commanderkeen.siajj.com]Keen Online[/url], it was basically a website where i started archiving infomation from the forum as well as other websites, just incase the infomation was deleted or the websites went offline (the ironie of it). But after starting the website i became busy with work so i posted articles onto [url=http://www.commanderkeen.siajj.com]Keen Online[/url] less and less. I eventually went to uni and my web hosting was the least of my finacial worries and so the website went offline.<br /><br />I recently found all the files for [url=http://www.commanderkeen.siajj.com]Keen Online[/url] on my hard drive again and now that i have hosting again i've decided to put them online again.<br /><br />Unfortunatly i won't be updating the website because it is no lorger a prioraty of mine anymore (although commander keen is still one of my favorite games), i mainly putting it online so that i know where to find installers etc for the games, so that i can play when in the mood.<br /><br />[url=http://www.commanderkeen.siajj.com]Keen Online[/url] should stay online as long as my other sites do ([url=http://www.siajj.com]Siajj[/url]), but if there is anyone out there who would like to take it on i am willing hand it over, but they most know php and mysql.<br /><br />I used to be very fond of this community and i would like to thank everyone who made it what it was and everybody who continue to keep it alive.<br /><br />Pete<br />(Keen Online)[img]http://commanderkeen.soupinajamjar.com/graphics/website/icon02.gif[/img] <b>Keen says:</b> [url=http://commanderkeen.soupinajamjar.com]Visit keen online for all you keen needs.[/url]"

Anouther reason why i din't want to update it because i created the code for the website a couple of years ago, although it's easy to view articles its a pain in the arse to post them. But over the christmas break i've created a blogging script for a couple of my other websites and one of the best things about it is that it's easy for me to post on it.<br /><br />I've had an idea of setting up a keen blog which posts all the latest infomation regarding fanart, fan games, mods, rumours etc, it would have RSS, so for those of you that use RSS you can get all the up to date info without having to open a browser and it would be a project i wouldn't mind doing.<br /><br />I'd like to hear other peoples views on it, if their was a blog would you use it?<br /><br />Keen Online<br /><br />P.S. A thing that i found the other day was that when i went to look for the last post i wrote on the pckf they had all been deleated by ezboard and it was only two years ago that i last posted.[img]http://commanderkeen.soupinajamjar.com/graphics/website/icon02.gif[/img] <b>Keen says:</b> [url=http://commanderkeen.soupinajamjar.com]Visit keen online for all you keen needs.[/url]"
