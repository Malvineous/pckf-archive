		"content": "As we've all probably experienced, there are many ways in which a game can be hard, or easy. If there was a new version of keen out and you wanted it to last you a long time and wanted to experience the most possible without having to play the game again what would you prefer the difficulty of the game to be (if it couldnt be changed)? <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><b>\"Easy\"</b> which basically lets you finish the game.<br /><b>\"Normal\"</b> Practically like Easy only a tiny harder, more enemies<br /><b>\"Hard\"</b> Professionally challenging, but definately possible<br /><b>\"n00b Hard\"</b> Very common in fan games where its so hard, its almost impossible because its stupid, e.g. thousands of monsters or bad level design.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I personally hate the n00b hard, i think this is what spoils alot of games which could have been good. I prefer hard, because its made to be possible and builds up our skill. If you like, you can mention a game you've played which has been ruined by the n00bness.---------<br />[img]http://img250.echo.cx/img250/9885/comicstrip9vf.gif[/img]"

But then, I guess it's also kinda cheating to Save-Load at every death, which I tend to do alot.<br /><br />Ultimately I suppose my attitude is similar to Jess and Xky's... I like to stroll through games and soak up the atmosphere and engross myself in the storyline... it's just that I have a habit of trying to push myself too much, as if to prove something to myself (so in a way my vote kinda leans toward n00b-hard).<br /><br />I can't bring myself to cheat through games anymore--or at least those that have an interesting storyline... I trainered NFS-UG because I prefer mindless driving to a level-style progression of events, and I intend to unlock everything in RCT and RCT2 next time I install them because I really dislike the their scenario-based nature--gimme classic Theme Park style blank slate genericism any day.<br /><br />Anyway, if there was a new Keen game released, I would prefer a harder difficulty, perhaps more like Normal in the originals, but unlimited lives and perhaps some sort of checkpoint system. I've never really been a fan of the whole 'Lives Left' concept.<br /><br />I guess this falls under 'Other'.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />\"This is how liberty dies--with thunderous applause.\" -Padme<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"

		"content": "I like hard games, but I find that the gameplay often limits the amount of challenge it's possible to build in.<br /><br />Three games that get hard well are the Descent games. Descent (I, II, or III) on insane is ridiculous, but the gameplay allows you enough freedom of motion that the only impediment is your skill. You rarely have a situation where you just can't get out of the way fast enough. You can fight your enemies, rather than fighting the game itself. You have enough tools to solve any problem (pwning the robots without getting killed yourself -- no real puzzles in this series). The Thief games do a good job as well. When you use your head and don't screw up, you can get past any point in the game without being at risk at all. It's not a fight to make your character do what you wanted instead of something else, and, again, you have a wide selection of tools. The Keen games are also pretty good in that regard, although you don't have many tools in them. Keen is very responsive to your commands, especially with the addition of the pogo.<br /><br />Other games don't get hard so well. You have to fight with the controls so much that you can't concentrate on the gameplay. I'm having some trouble thinking of examples, but Jill of the Jungle, while much loved, has a horrible control system. All your jumps are the same height, and movement is jerky as well. Those two problems killed my fun quick. While it might be playable in difficult situations, I wouldn't even want to try, so that qualifies it for my \"fighting the game rather than the enemies\" category. Xargon, of course, has this same problem. Heretic II suffers from it too. Corvus doesn't move like an agile elf warrior at all, so the game is often frustrating. It does, at least, give you plenty of tools.<br /><br />So, while I like to be challenged by a game's contents, I don't like to be challenged by the game itself.  Hard games are good, as long as I have enough options to solve the problems I see. Like Jess, Xky, and Spleen, I like a good story, and good scenery, but if the gameplay is too easy, I lose interest. I couldn't even finish the Wheel of Time game, because it was too sickeningly dull to play. I'll soak up the ambiance while I'm not occupied. I just don't want that to be all the time.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/YorpEye.png[/img]"
