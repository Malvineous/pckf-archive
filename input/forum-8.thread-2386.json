I'm over 15000 kilometres away from home, travelling alone, and staying at people who I have never met (and most of them never met even online).<br />So, this is the reason why I have been offline so much. I haven't had either time to surf or free internet access. I must be brief since time is ticking and I don't want to pay an extra Australian dollar.<br /><br />It's been quite fun, indeed. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-yorp.gif[/img]  I've felt down right on my knees once again, my knees are bruised. (Hopefully correct word.) Ouch..<br /><br />I didn't tell about this trip because I was going to meet Spleen and visit ShedQuarters and we were going to surprise you all.. Haha.. Ironically that won't happen now because some four aboriginal youths stole my and my (new) friend's wallets (and also punched my friend a few times).. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br />I'm currently in Melbourne.. Going back to Sydney soon.<br /><br />I'll be back on track (home) on 23rd..<br /><br />--KR [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img] <br /><br />PS. Those who know the reason why I'm in Australia, please do NOT tell it! Cheers.

KeenRush is three measly hours away and about to vanish again.<br /><br />We were going to gather in Melbourne and catch up with Spike and whoever else we could find, but there wouldn't have been enough time to do that and come back to Lakes (only four days), so the plan was for KR to come down here. By the time misfortune struck, it was too late to make alternative plans.<br /><br />Oh, well. Someday."
