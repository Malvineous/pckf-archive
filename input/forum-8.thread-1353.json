I guess they want marriage as much as you do.. Besides, gay couples can adobt or have someone to birth them a baby, although I don't support that kind of families at all.<br /><br />At least so far I've heard about homosexuality in school only couple of times, if even that. I'm pretty sure there's no subliminal messaging to encourage in it (here). I'd guess it would be other way around here, Finland's population growth is really low.<br /><br />Anyways, as I've probably made clear, I'm not defending gays, this whole matter doesn't concern me at all since I don't even know anyone who is one.[url=http://www.keengrid.net/]keengrid.net[/url]"

Not surprisingly about this age or a little younger is when the brain has finally developed an understanding of the world around it, and because it has only just grasped it, it rebels against anything different.  This explains why Najawa feels so strongly against the concept of homosexuality - it goes against everything he's been taught up to this point in his life, and at this stage of mental development the only way the brain can cope is to reject the concept.<br /><br />It's not until the brain has developed further that it can cope with these concepts.  That's why it was the youngest members of this forum posting the \"eww gay\" messages and the older members saying \"you should be more tolerant\" - tolerance only comes once the brain has developed further, often referred to as \"maturity.\"<br /><br />So there's no point trying to prove there's nothing wrong with being gay, it'll happen eventually once the brain has reached a certain stage of development.  Unless of course it's fed intolerant information by those around it, but that's another issue altogether...<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, according to this story the brain doesn't fully develop until the age of 25 (!) which would explain why there are still immature people around in their early 20's, but very few immature 30 year olds.  Luckily it's a lot sooner than this for most of us... [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

What assholes for hogging up all the hatred.<br /><br />I'll tell you what's greedy: a man and a woman marry, have four kids, get divorced and start arguing over who gets the kids, just for the sake of money and ego, refusing to look squarely at what scenario might be most beneficial to the kids.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Najawa</b> The only thing a gay 'marriage' does, is gives them a tax deduction.<br />[hr]While some may abuse the system, which is also the case with 'normal' marriage, it's basically a means of attaining official recognition.

For starters, my girlfriend is bisexual, as is one of my best friends' girlfriend. There's a gay guy who left town some time ago who used to hang out and party and a friend of Mum's who is a transexual (which does not necessarily equate to homosexual, and indeed does not in this case).<br /><br />They're all classy, as far as people in general go, far better people than some of the fucling mainstream jackasses that call themselves normal.

Homosexuality in males appears to be more dictated by 'brain wiring'; if your brain is wired up the 'wrong' way, you're gay.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Are you sure? I heard it was improper hormone dosage during pregnancy to the baby, often caused by stress related issues. Do you have a source, out of curiosity?[hr][/quote] <br /><br />This has been discredited by hormone studies in men and women. There are a surprising number of testosterone rich women and estrogen rich men living out there, and only a slight correlation with homosexuality exists. Interestingly, if you get a lot of testosterone in the womb, you''l have lots of sons. Plenty of estrogen? Then daughters for you.

You're born like that, and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it.[hr][/quote] <br /><br />On the contrary, with a course of therapy there is a pretty good 'cure' rate for homosexuality.A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

It is actually possible to change sexual orientation through therapy, just is it is possible [and indeed much easier] to fabricate memories of rape and child abuse.<br /><br />Of course we aren't talking 10% here, often not even 1% and even then 'partial cures' of varying degrees and relapses are rife.
