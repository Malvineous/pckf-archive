		"content": "While talking to one of my friends about Dimension Chaos I was suddenly worried. I have never attempted romance before. Knowing that it will be a huge theme in Dimension Chaos (wont tell ya who Keen falls in love with. Its a new character I made) I would need practice writing romance. I then came up with a cool idea for a action/adventure/romance sonic fic thats a dark story but not too dark. Dimension Chaos is not on hold and I'm working on both stories at the same time but this one will definatly be shorter than dimension chaos. Anyways I'll stop rambling on and give ya the link.<br />[url=http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2535161/1/]www.fanfiction.net/s/2535161/1/[/url]<br />Please read and review and thanks in advance.<br />Edit 2: Chapter 2 is up.Check out my blog at [url=http://spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/]spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/[/url]<br />Check out my fanfics at [url=http://www.fanfiction.net/u/680124/]fanfiction.net[/url]"
