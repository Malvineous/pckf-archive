It's too bad that there's still no way to purchase Keen 6.<br /><br />EDIT: I wonder if they have been edited from the original, you'd expect them to run under XP if they release them like this.<br />EDIT2: Just read from somehwere that DOSBox is being used fro running these games, interesting seeing as no credit is given anywhere."

I wonder what version are they? Probably the Vorticons are 1.31 and then Galaxy 1.4. It's very good to see something related to the official games, like this. It could create some interest in Keen again, and perhaps finally the rights could end up to Tom's hands. And anyways, as it's almost 20 years since the release of the games, the re-run culture gets interested in the early 90s soon, and then!
