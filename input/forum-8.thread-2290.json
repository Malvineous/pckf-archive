		"content": "Uh, bp, not to discredit you or anything, but there's a few things wrong with this post.  <b>One</b>, you mis-spelled Ilsoap's name.  It's hard to sound reputable when you're not going to take the time to spell everything accurately.  <b>Two</b>, you don't have any sources linked in your statement.  How can you criticize Ilsoap's argument as being \"one voice against another,\" when that is precisely the type of argument you have established here?  <b>Three</b>, I'm not sure what you're really trying to get at, with this post.  Do you want the Keen community to rally around a cause, either yours or Ilsoap's?  Are you trying to make somebody look stupid?  Why post this, and then edit in an acknowledgement that it's an unnecessary topic?  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"

However, if some kids (20 year old old? [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img] ) are intentionally damaging the game I can see no harm suing them. However, that may just have been a threat to make them stop, that's all. It'd be not worth one's time suing kids for something, or well, don't know the USA law, perhaps they could be sentenced to death there.
