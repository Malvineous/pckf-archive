It includes one full level, without an exit point since there's nowhere to go once you exit.<br />[url=http://keen.keenx.com/keen/files/keen_alpha.zip]keen.keenx.com/keen/files/keen_alpha.zip[/url]<br /><br />There's a lot to do still. For example, the swimming movement is crap, and the dopefish is way too slow. And possibly too dumb too, but he IS a dopefish!<br />Ledge climbing control has some work to do. Just remember, when you grab a ledge, you'll need to release the direction you want to climb, and then press it again if you want to climb up. Or press down to let go.<br />Slikey is there. Don't be too mean, he has limited vision, can see only directly in front of him for a short distance. At least he can see through walls. He gets a little excited and surprised when he sees you.<br />The graphics reflect the completion of the game. (Not complete.)<br />Also, there are over 71,000 points in the level.<br /><br />Big thanks to Commander Spleen who has helped a lot with finding bugs! I even fixed a couple of them.

I'd like to be able to avoid grabbing a ledge until I'm falling back DOWN.<br /><br />2) If I'm swimming in the water, and I just hold up and left or up and right, Keen spazzes out and twitches along the top of the water... can you fix that?<br /><br />3) Enemies I've already stunned get in the way of shooting other enemies!  I juggle corpses, rather than shooting multiple enemies!  Is this intentional?<br /><br />Other than that, the new sprite looks good so far.  Work on keeping Keen's proportions more stable, and keep your perspectives matching... but otherwise very nice as a pre-beta."

So nothing is really polished or demo-worthy, but here's a quick list of what's been added since the demo:<br />1. Map mode (and switching from a map to a level and back)<br />2. Game menu (escape goes to the menu rather than closing the game)<br />3. Sounds (shamelessly ripped a couple from keen 4 for testing)<br />4. Music<br />5. Settings (custom controls, volume, etc.)<br />6. Level loading progress bar<br /><br />I like to update the progress on the project occasionally for anyone who's interested. But since I don't want to clutter the PCKF with little updates, I've been posting small updates to my message board at [url=http://forums.keenx.com]forums.keenx.com[/url]<br />Feel free to visit. And of course it's open to any keeners, so join and discuss if you'd like."

It would also work much better if you drew it from scratch. If you can make it animate like that blue critter, you'll be doing well.<br /><br />Might I suggest rethinking the way you render your images? IMKO, the default-Photoshop style shading makes the image feel even flatter than the unshaded version.<br /><br />Looking at Z's avatar, I notice he uses a similar technique but somehow manages to make it work.
