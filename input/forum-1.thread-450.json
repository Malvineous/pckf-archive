As far as I can tell, the game's freeware.<br /><br />Why get ripped off when you can do a google search for keen6.zip and download it. If the keen6.zip file is above 500 kilobytes, it's the full thing. Usually, v1.0 gets posted but you can always come back to [url=http://dosclassics.com/keen/dl.php?id=of]dosclassics.com/keen/dl.php?id=of[/url] and download the v1.0 to v1.4 patch and the v1.4 to v1.5 patch and update the game accordingly."
