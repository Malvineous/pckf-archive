		"content": "Even though I dont really like rap (I'm a rocker dammit!) I've learned in the past never to judge a game unless you played it. Like when I played the first Full metal alchemist game for PS2 I thought I would love it since I'm a huge fan of FMA and it was from Square enix (who made some of my fav games) but then it turned out to be horrible. The second game is good though so I'm glad they improved. Anyways the point is you cant make assumptions on a game based on who it is or what the game is gonna be like. You can hate it if its not your type of game but that doesnt mean that the game is good or not. Like I never really much cared for Grand theft auto yet I know its a good game but its not my type of game (i dont care much for the violence in the game). And thats my 2 cents of the day [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-crazy.gif[/img] Check out my blog at [url=http://spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/]spaces.msn.com/members/superadammario/[/url]<br />Check out my fanfics at [url=http://www.fanfiction.net/u/680124/]fanfiction.net[/url]"
