I run on Windows XP with DOSBox and the games run great, but when I try to use the debug keys command (A+2+Enter, right?) it does nothing. I like to play around with god mode and stuff sometimes to just blow off frustration, so if anyone has ideas on what's wrong, I'd greatly appreciate it. (Also, with Keen 1 the God and Item cheats work just fine)<br /><br />Thanks in advance."

		"content": "Like most games of the era, Keen bypasses the BIOS and goes straight to the keyboard controller, so it would only depend on the keyboard manufacturer.  Cheaper keyboards tend to only work with one or two keys held down at the same time, because they connect too many keys to each conducting track on the keyboard underlay.  More expensive keyboards (especially gamer keyboards) have more tracks, and less keys per track, so they're far more reliable when it comes to multikey combinations.<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"
