I got the holy Genmidi.op2.<br /><br />However, when I export a MIDI to MUS file, and then the MUS to IMF, and play it in my favourite music player with IMF capability, some of these generated IMFs have timing issues. In some parts the song goes incredibly slow for minutes, and then incredibly fast for a pair of seconds. The original MIDI file doesn't have those speed irregularities.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether the bug is caused in the MIDI2MUS process or in MUS2IMF. DaVince should've already noticed it.<br /><br />I've not had enough time to use a MUS player and see where the bug's coming from.
