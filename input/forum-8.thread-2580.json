If it makes you this mad: [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-furious.gif[/img] <br />5. If it's hard to install and/or setup.<br /><br />I would preffer it if<br /><br />1. It's windows only<br />2. It makes you this happy: [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] <br />3. It's freeware<br />4. It has cool featues<br />5. Easy to make the background transparent<br /><br />(note: I have 2 ways of making GIFs, both of which are horrible: GameMaker ([img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-furious.gif[/img]  ) And Easy GIF Maker ([img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sick.gif[/img]  ). Game maker barely has enough abilities (no transparent backrounds, hard to control the rate of each frame, and oh, so much more.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-furious.gif[/img]  ), and Easy GIF Maker just...

Although, you could always use it in conjunction with [url=http://gifworks.com/image_editor.html]GIFWorks[/url], which DOES have a bunch of nifty features, including transparency, but doesn't actually let you assemble GIFs.<br /><br />Of course, it sounds like GIFWorks is really all you need.[center]<font color=\"MAROON\">TOUGH GUYS DON'T FOLLOW FADS</font>[/center]"
