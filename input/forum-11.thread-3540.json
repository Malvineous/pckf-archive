[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopekeen.gif[/img] <br /><br />There's probably some program that will do it (it's actually something that could always be added to DOSBox) but the easiest would be to get a video card with TV-out, then unplug your monitor and plug the TV in - the PC will then boot on the TV and you can then play Keen on the TV as well, and either record on another PC with a TV capture card, or record it on your VCR - pretty bad quality, but it'd work!

Better than VHS[hr][/quote]Actually they're not - well, not much better anyway - almost all standalone DVD recorders on the market are analogue units - basically VHS with a disc instead of a tape.  You need to go digital before the quality *really* improves - a proper digital DVD recorder would presumably have a DVI input plug on it, which is the standard for transferring digital TV (almost all digital TVs have a DVI socket on them.)  Which interestingly enough is the same as many PCs now (the DVI connection is often used to connect an LCD monitor to your PC.)  I don't know whether connecting your PC straight to the DVD recorder would work though...but I think it works connecting your digital TV to your computer, so who knows!"
