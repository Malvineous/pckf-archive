I use virtual GB-sized instruments as well.. what ones did you use?<br /><br />EDIT: These are REALLY good!!<br /><br />Reminds me to work on Apogee music sometime.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  I should record the HP music from the original MIDI source (Roland Sound Canvas). Sounds awesome on a SC.<br /><br />I have so many Apogee MIDI's/IMF's.. Must do it generally.<br /><br />Reminds me, I recorded the Realms of Chaos soundtrack digitally not so long ago as well.<br /><br /><br />I'll start a new request remix topic though (was going to post it here).<br /><br />- Spike"
