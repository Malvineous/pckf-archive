All I could find though was the \"Aliens Ate my Babysitter\" high rez pics off of the 3d realms site (or wherever). Unfortunately the size was not quite big enough to print. It would only come out to like 5 by 4 inches. (350 dpi)<br /><br />I was going to make my own shirt. But then it would be in my style and not the official Commander Keen style. If I ever finish it though, I will be sure to upload the pic so you can make your own.<br /><br />If you want the thumbs up pose, I suggest you draw over the pic or something. That picture is not in high rez anywhere. I could probably do it but I am doing other things at the moment. Maybe later.-----------------------<br />\"The Adventures of Commander Keen\" issue #1: coming soon."
