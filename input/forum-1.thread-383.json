A bug or something? It was very frustrating before I could made it there by the regular way.

I don't know the person who played that game originally, but I guess he or she jumped onto the platform and a bug caused the platform to fall to the bottom edge like if there was no BLOCK below it.<br /><br />I've been wondering about this strange issues since I was 9 years old.<br /><br />edit: de-italicized it.------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].

(With a Bip though, not a platform.) the saved game keeps track of all the sprites in the sprite array, and, if like a point that's been got, it isn't in the file, it won't be in the level. Thus you can, if you're smart, customize your saved games, both with score, lives and such, and sprites. (You can even shift Keen somewhere impossible, that's how I did my impossible places in Biomenace.)[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Awww! Feel the love!"
