I made these pictures today..<br />By the way, still have no that drawing table thing that could be useful when drawing. As well, I haven't practiced at all since my previous garg related picture here. Sorry! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-embarrassed.gif[/img] <br />As well, didn't bother tweaking and editing the pictures more, the quality may suck but who cares.<br /><br />Here's traditional garg. I was drawing it and having KeenGrid front page in mind, but probably I won't add it there. I kinda don't like how it turned out, but here's it anyways.<br /><br />[img]http://keengrid.net/keenrush/gridgarg.png[/img]<br /><br /><br />Then, here's two garg-humanoid (gargnoid?) pictures. I added KeenGrid message to this picture just for fun, although there isn't much to see in KG.. But I'm working on redesign and a new site. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br />[img]http://keengrid.net/keenrush/vkgt.png[/img]<br /><br /><br />And finally, I'm not sure if I should post this one, but here it goes anyways. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-embarrassed.gif[/img]  Afterall, this shows no details or anything (if you see something it's your imagination). If you would be offended easily (although there is no reason to), just do NOT scroll down.. But well, I guess some older members might like it.

Alot different to good ol' pixelart.<br /><br />Instead of using the airbrush straight away, I'd suggest trying a smaller pencil-like tool that doesn't antialias [drawing it in Paint first would be easiest]. That way, you can erase and redraw all you need until you're happy with it, then go over the final linework with the airbrush.

I don't have any evidence, nothing said in this topic (or well, maybe LL's reply a bit, but knowing her it's probably joking or something), I just figured it out because of the fact the usual posters/spammers haven't said a word. Everyone that has said something is someone a bit older and/or more mature member of the forum who can look 'art' without freaking out.

I only meant I won't post everything on PCKF -- you can most probably see everything on the gargoid page if/when I make one.
