It'd take a lot more skills to write a game in such, unless interpreting something more advanged language in it first, which'd obviously slow down a lot if using old computer.

It's *really* nice.  I used it in my game editor for the scripting code which allows you to describe file formats in XML.

		"content": "Umm...you might want to re-read that, it didn't quite make sense (\"integer to string is easy, but I'm talking integer to string\"??)<br /><br />By the way, your first bit of code (string s = \"\" + i) won't actually work.  The reason is that C and C++ are designed to be powerful languages that can do many things, but they're not designed to be easy.  The reason there's no \"parseInt\" is because that could limit the functionality - what if you wanted to parse a hexadecimal integer?  Or a binary int?  atoi() was the C answer for a few common cases to make it easier, and string streams (think sprintf() in C) are the C++ answer.  You're always free to write your own parseInt function if you want.  Personally I prefer a toString function, because then you can overload it, so instead of having parseInt, parseLong, etc. you can just have multiple toString functions and the compiler will automatically pick which one you want at compile-time.<br /><br />The reason why you have to convert a std::string using c_str() is because atoi() is a C function, so you shouldn't be using it in a pure C++ program.  If you use the string streams like in my last post, then you won't need to convert anything to C style strings.  You might find the syntax horrible and complicated, but that's how it's done in C++.  Besides, you can wrap it in a parseInt function and then forget about it if you're not quite ready to move to fully-fledged C++.<br /><br />(By the way, as an aside C++ has no \"string\" type.  There is a string defined in the std namespace, but this is almost always written as std::string.  There are ways around this, but you [url=http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/coding-standards.html#faq-27.5]won't be very popular if you use them[/url].)<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"
