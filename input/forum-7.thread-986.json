But anways,<br /><br />I just found these forums while looking and I've read quite a few posts and I was just wondering, are there any programs to extract the \"graphics\" from the EGAHEAD.CK3 file or EGASPRIT.CK3, files?<br /><br />Because if not, I can always screen shot each individual tiling myself (For myself). I use a program called DOSBox which I'm sure most of you use.<br /><br />Thanks in advance! Help's always appreciated."

I'm still unable to find out where the \"World Map\" view's located; So you can completely entirely 100% edit the Commander Keen universe. So you can begin to make your own Campaigning Series."

		"content": "Good point, Oblivious; sorry for not giving more details.  <br /><br />In this case, there's really not many tools you'll need to create a Keen mod, especially if you're content to cut your teeth on Keen1-3 (which are much more documented).  <br /><br />ModKeen is a command line program that will export and import your graphics--it comes with a helpfile, or you can just type \"modkeen /help\" at the command prompt.  Typically you'll run \"modkeen -export -episode=n\" once, to get all the graphics out, and then rig a batch file to do \"modkeen -import -episode=n\" from there on, for your testing.  From there, it's just file after file of MSPaint, Gimp, Photoshop, or what have you--changing all those frames of animation and background takes time!<br /><br />After you've finished enough of the tiles that you want to see them in action, you'll need one of the editors... that's where your choice comes in.  All of them work, (arguably,) but each has functions exclusive to it.  I'm not even sure what the editor of choice is, these days--but I'm confident you'll find one that works for you.  Plop your tiles down, and playtest to your heart's content. <br /><br />Finally, (and some might say most importantly,) there's the Patching process.  The CKxPatch utilities are another command line program--your final mod will have a batch file that simply runs \"CKxPatch mymod.pat\", which starts the episode of Keen with your patch file's info.  Use any text editor to put in your patches; change jump height, change enemy AI, change the text of all the menus, etc.  <br /><br />Your final product will be a collection of LEVELxx.CKn files, the graphics files, and your patch file.  Any users who download your mod will have to provide their own copy of Keen, and then unzip your mod's files into their directory, overwriting as necessary.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />A lot of this might SOUND complicated, but it becomes almost self-explanatory if you just download a few mods and give them a shot.  Not to sound like another \"refer to\" post, but check out http://www.keenmodding.org for more info. <br /><br />Hope that was useful!  :k[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"
