		"content": "Anyone familar with this fan fic series? Its probably one of the best fics I have ever read and I found it to be highly inspiring for me. Its a more serious dramatic adventure with a crossover between Mario/sonic/Zelda/Megaman with countless other sequels which expand the universe with other characters. And many other fanfic writers making their own arcadia fics theres no wonder why Anthony Bault's series is so popular. Anyways check it out if you have the time (they are very long) and if you ever get confused check out his faq.<br /><br />First fic:<br />[url=http://www.fanfiction.net/s/268885/1/]www.fanfiction.net/s/268885/1/[/url]<br /><br />Other fics:<br />[url=http://www.fanfiction.net/u/62986/]www.fanfiction.net/u/62986/[/url]The end is near. An evil force returns. And only Commander Keen can stop him, but this time he must team up with a super sonic hedgehog and a two tailed fox.
