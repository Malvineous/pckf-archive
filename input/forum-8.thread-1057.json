This was one of my first PC games, I was about 5 or 6 years old when I first saw C.K.<br />My favourite episodes were always 4, 5 and 6. Now I'm using DOSbox and Windows XP to play Keen. I'm from Poland, so forgive me my mistakes, if you see something wrong, you can correct me.<br />Oh - and you have some extremely cool emoticons!

How old are you now, if I may ask? And yeah, these emoticons are cool!

English is my native language and I can't even pronouce it correctly mainly due to the heavy German influence on the local dialect around in this area.
