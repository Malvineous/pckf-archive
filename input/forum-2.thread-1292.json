But here's the current progress.(no screenshots yet sorry).<br />I tried editing the tiled of the ship parts but they look like crap to me so i have overwritten it with the original tiles. <br />So here is little request could you make ine of the part tiles look like an ancient lamps(the kind believed to have an genie in them). I would really appreciate it if you did(might even throw you in the credits). I almost finished the logo file so i might post it after i finished it. This is not real.<br />You did not see this.<br />You werent here."
