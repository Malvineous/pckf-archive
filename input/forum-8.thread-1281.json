[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img]  Losing a pet is not nice.<br /><br />* Well, it doesn't make you any cooler in my eyes if you've known the guy. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img]  You probably mean Keen Dreams, since iD owns the rights to the other games. As well, doesn't help much that you knew him, since he still owns the rights. Also, Keen Dreams rights wouldn't help Tom making a new Keen game, since as far as I know those are just the rights to distribute and sell the specific game (Keen Dreams in this case).<br /><br />* Well, good luck. Haven't heard of you working on that project.<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"
