Isn't that amusing? We were talking a bout the first time we played a deathmatch game of Doom, which happ[ened to be at a mutyual friend's dad's 40th many years ago, and we started talking about holding a DOS LAN.<br /><br />Woogh.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm still around. My ex just left for a oine-night stand and food. She's insane, and quite liost. I see it's been quiet around here... I ewxpect to see at least a new mod when I return full-0tiome!@!<br /><br />HARDCORE!<br /><br />Uh, sorry about the ranting and spam-like nature of this post, but I figure I might as well post something to let y'all know I'm still alive.<br /><br />Hahahah. Corey got kicked out of his bed. He just returned to the kitchen for more food. This place is amusing. I think we just freaked him out.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />A concerned member of the Preservation of Endangered Spleens Society<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />I remember playing Deathmatch Doom (and of course coop-always-turns-into-DM-after-a-stray-rocket Doom) in the past, and have fond memories of that as well.<br />I installed [url=http://www.skulltag.com/]Skulltag[/url] (hey, apparently there's a trailer now in case you're interested) a long time ago, but I never really started playing it.<br />That reminds me, I also still want to play through Doom: Collector's Edition with ZDoomGL sometime.<br /><br />Anyway, I found that a good game of UT2004 (I only started chatting online with my friends/enemies after the game(s) with this game, since I only had dialup in my Doom days) makes my typing a LOT worse than drinking ever did.<br />Too much adrenaline apparently influences my motor skills more than alcohol.<br /><br />Uhm... hoorray for beer!?Retodon8<br />Sheep happens!
