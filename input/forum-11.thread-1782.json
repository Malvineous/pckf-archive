I haven't had a chance to work on fixing the issue with my improvements to the Adlib synth, but the file below both sounds good and gives you an idea of what it is I'm trying to fix.<br /><br />[url=http://www.shikadi.net/gamemusic/cavebash.ogg]cavebash.ogg[/url]<br /><br />You'll notice at about 0:43 and 1:42 there's a really low note - much lower than it should be and it sounds quite out of place.  A lot of songs are doing something along these lines and although I have a pretty good idea why, it's just a matter of me sitting down and figuring out a satisfactory solution to it.  There are a few other places in the song where this happens, but they're not as noticeable as the two times above.<br /><br />Oh, and if you've ever played Vinyl Goddess from Mars, the [url=http://www.shikadi.net/gamemusic/vinylintro.ogg]theme music[/url] rocks [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

These files are much smaller than MP3s (the entire Keen 4-6 soundtrack is the same size as a ~20 second MP3), and you can play them in Winamp.  You can also use Winamp to convert them to .wav which is usually better than DOSBox since you get the proper length of the song (otherwise it can be difficult to know when the song loops.)"
