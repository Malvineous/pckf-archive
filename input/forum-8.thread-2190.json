Overnight three nukes had been set off around us. We woke at a very early hour to find their smoky remnants. Shortly thereafter a fireworks display was set off, as a plausible explanation for all the smoke, supposedly as part of a sporting event. It actually formed two dreams, in the midst of which I awoke in the darkness thinking, \"Man, I hope that's a dream...\"<br /><br />Prior to that there was another dream where I had sleep paralysis and could only move my hands. Raising them in front of me, I found only faint glowing outlines, and announced, \"My hands are invisible!\"<br /><br />Through a related YouTube video I discovered [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand]this[/url].

My only concern is when things you wouldn't do in public are also monitored (e.g. a phone conversation you wouldn't repeat in public, or e-mail/IM.)  Thank goodness for encryption.<br /><br />Interestingly enough their take on trusted computing (that you can only run MS programs, and not say Linux) was odd, considering Linux itself supports trusted computing.  They also make it sound like people will be forced to buy computers with 'trusted computing chips', but I'd be surprised if a) no manufacturers offer TPM-free alternatives or b) 'how to desolder your TPM chip' takes longer than a couple of weeks to appear online [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"
