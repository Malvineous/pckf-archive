Spider-man, on the other hand, was based on a comic book *series,* and had more to work with, so the sequels were probably just as good, or better.<br />Of course, I still need to see them to know for sure. But I'm guessing I'll like Spider-Man 3 better than Shrek 3 and Pirates 3 combined.<br /><br />If you ask me, though, a sequel is only really good if it's part of the whole story (such as Harry Potter.)-Genius314<br />[url=http://planetck.spatang.com]PlanetCK[/url]"
