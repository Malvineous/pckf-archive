It is a think media laptop, and was made for watching DVD's, listening to music, and playing games. It was a power-house of it's times!<br /><br />We updated from Win95 to Win98SE (So I could use a memory stick), and lost our DVD decoders in the proscess.

One of my current projects is building some of those computers I bought last year into ber tweaked oldschool beasts and selling them off cheap. Some of them will be designed for DOS gaming, others as SOHO machines (it's amazing what you can still do with a P200 with a tweaked out Win9[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dexter.gif[/img]  .<br /><br />Most of those machines didn't come with HDDs so I'm buying as many &lt; 40Gb drives as I can. It's amazing how many people pay excessive prices for such small drives though.<br /><br />One of my more tasty purchases was for 16 20\" CRT monitors, at a total of $610.22 including postage. They're bloody heavy, but they work damn nice. And they sell for around $100 each. The funny thing is, after using such massive screens for a couple of weeks, 15\" monitors start to look more and more like toys every time I walk past one. [edited: paragraph was broken]<br /><br />[hr]<b>Malvineous</b> I got it because I'm tired of having all my computers piled up all over the floor and it's a nice geeky way of tidying things up.<br />[hr]Gah. Ebay refuses to load on my dodgebox connection at the moment. I like the sound of that rack, though. I'm hoping to build one sometime soon, with space for maybe 10 PCs and a built-in switch. As it stands I find it difficult to have more than four computers setup in my shed without running out of space.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Malvineous</b> A lot of people seem to say that, but I've only had a few dud things off eBay and most of the time the sellers accepted them back and gave me a refund.<br />[hr]Likewise. As long as you keep an eye on sellers' feedback scores, I've found that people are generally quite reasonable when it comes to faulty products and such.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
