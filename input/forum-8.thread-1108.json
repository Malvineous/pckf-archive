		"content": "After having an argument with my parents (no details), the result is simple and short: no internet connection till our economical problems are over. Worse than that, I'll probably have to stay away from the computer for some months (or years).<br /><br />So I probably won't be here, at least not very active. And my mods will be delayed by this situation. However, as the modding work decreases, the concept art for the mods increases, so when I return, I'll probably be able to quickly finish the mods (Keen 1 mod \"lost in the shadows\" and keen 4 mod \"Back to the Future\", temporary name anyway).<br /><br />With the possibility of accessing internet from the computers at the university, it's more likely that I'll strut around from time to time and speak something, and upload the mods as soon as each one of them are finished. I'll then have to forget about beta-testing, unless there's someone with enough spare time that will always be avaiable for betatesting.

Good signal, perhaps this is gonna be a good year for you after all.<br /><br />Anyways, whenever I get near a Internet connection and a proper computer (we have a computer room in the university running Fedora Core), I'll check the forums.<br /><br />Perhaps this is the time for someone to gimme an answer to my old question, the answer to the Universe, life and everything...<br /><br />\"WHY in the hell I stumbled upon a Keen 6 v1.0 savegame of level 14 \"Bloogbase Management District\" in which one of the floating platforms near the end (you know, just above the bridge that you must open) wasn't there, thus making the level impossible to finish without cheats?\" I remember that didn't happen if I started a new game and made it there, it was just the saved game. A bug or something? It was very frustrating before I could made it there by the regular way. (NOTE: I didn't know the cheats back then)------------------<br /><b>SM:</b> <i>\"I could go and write a page about the Theory of Relativity (or whatever it's called), but, what is the point if I don't know what the Theory of Relativity is?\"</i><br /><br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]"
