This really shouldn't take that long, just how many classes do you need to explain the nature of E and ID? The rest of bio is pretty much neutral, what does sugar metabolisim have to do with God?<br /><br />However;<br /><br />Those who think ID will create a world where nobody investigates things because 'its all Gods work' should be taken outside and soundly beaten.

For example, recent 'evolving algorithims' have benefitted from the recent postulate that evolution occurs in 'jumps' Rather than evolve slowly each program is rapidly 'mutated' like in nature, and stressed. This creates some very interesting and unexpected results. Recently a program with 'junk code' appeared; most of the junk was removable, but a small bit wasn't, yet it didn't interact at all with the rest of the code.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/lind.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

He then stopped it moving all at once with a metal bar, which would then snap in two with great force, free energy! He managed to get this before congress. A resident physicist explained things and he left, embarassed, but admitting his error, to go on to build a flour mill.<br /><br />In 1996 Mr Newman, inventor of the Newman engine did the same thing, he also had an engine that 'consumed its own wires' to give free energy. Both devices were proven fraudulent.<br /><br />He claimed massive coverup, aliens, and more inventions. He now has his own company and a multimillion dollar investment fund.<br /><br />*sigh* [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-shikadi.gif[/img] <br /><br /><br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/lind.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
