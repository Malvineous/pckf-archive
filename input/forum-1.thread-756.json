Damping Hub), you'll fall to an invisible corridor. Walk left, let yourself fall thru, and you'll reach a room which you must make it past in order to get to the teleporter.

Instead, I went through the door that's before the arch, and I randomly popped out on Korath III.<br /><br />I was left tantalized for a couple years, because I could only play the level for about 6 seconds before the game crashed.  The error has never repeated itself since, but it sure was wierd when it happened."
