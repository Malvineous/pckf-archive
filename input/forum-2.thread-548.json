I haven't exactly been keeping track of when specific things were released.  Check out the Release Forum, because there's some good things there.  Also, you can go see Garg's Mod Maze, which seems to be pretty up to date on Keen mods.  There's been one Keen 4 mod released (Keys of Krodacia) which is really awesome, so you should go look into that.[img]http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k284/KeegTech/WarholDopefishPNG2.png[/img]"
