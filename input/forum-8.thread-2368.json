Apparently, ezBoard has decided to try and float up on the blog-forum-image-gallery-social-networking-kitchen-sink bubble in their new incarnation: tags, RSS feeds, Ajax and all. Additionally, it's way harder to use, more ugly and generally much more irritating. I hope that we get out of this frying pan that is ezBoard before we're thrown into the roaring, Javascripted, Myspace-clone fire that is Yuku. Ugh.<br /><br />On the plus side, Yuku forums have a much nicer URL layout [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] [url=http://toxicsheep.com]toxicsheep.com[/url] | [url=http://commanderkeen.org]coming up next...[/url]"
