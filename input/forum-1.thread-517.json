How I felt when I found the secret level on episode 1 in response to how you have to get there (ride ice cube over wall)  Prolly others, but can't think of them - been so long since the games were so fresh as to illicit wow like response.<br /><br />Being impressed by some stuff in Xky's keen 1 mod, including but not limited to the train of two eyed green things at the end of the penultimate level.  Btw, Xky, been playing your episode 2 mod, but don't enjoy it half as much as your ep 1 to be honest.  It is growing on me, though, but all the black ninja rifle dudes really get me sour and the super fast ghost skeliton things are annoying me less as time goes on but still annoying.  Too many unpredictable elements in the game now.  Just causes lots of frustration.  The artwork is decent, if not better than your first mod.  Wish there were some secrets in the levels.  Lots of secrets are what make a game have good replayability.  Episode 4 I played sooo much just so I could find all the secrets.
