		"content": "Yesterday I attended a UFO confrence. But not just any confrence; this one was about recovered UFO's; it was a talk about alien physiology, recovered fragments that were passed around the auidience, and diagrams of how the craft were supposed to fly before they crashed. Each speaker was adressed with riotus appplause and total credulity.<br /><br />A few months back, just before the election I went to a Destiny Church rally, where I head of 'Bishop' Tamaki's valiant attempts to make NZ into the worlds first [yeah right] theocracy. It was filled with nutcases, and the exact same applause.<br /><br />This has got me thinking; just what do you think is the most ridiculous belief and why? I'm not talking most dangerous or objectionable, but the one that makes you think 'Dear Lord [or Nonexistent Omnipotent Diety] how the hell [or nonexistent place of punishment] can someone possibly believe that?\"<br /><br />To remove some of the impending discussion I have defined each belief by a statement often associated with the extremity of belief I think is appropriate.<br /><br />Christianity/Islam, etc: We are right, all those who do not believe will burn in hell forever, let us go out and bash gays!<br /><br />UFOlogists: Aliens visit us regularly, they abduct and experiment on peole and the govt hushes it all up. We have actual demonstratable scientific proof of this.<br /><br />New Agers: Horoscopes, palm reading, telepathy, magic, homoeopathy and etc all work 100%, we don't need scientific proof, these things can't be measured by science.<br /><br />Athesisim: There is no God and anyone who believes there is is a total idiot.<br /><br />Other: Any other belief you think is criminally stupid.

There's no pain or suffering in heaven, so what's the problem?<br />JW: ...<br />Sz: Also, how ridiculous is the notion of an omnipotent deity who sat around for an unimaginable amount of time doing bugger all, before suddenly, and for no apparent reason, deciding to create an entire universe, and then populating just one single, insignificant speck of it, with a couple of million species, and granting only one species an immortal soul? (I read this somewhere, I keep it handy)<br />JW: *eats my cookies and leaves*<br /><br />To his credit, he did leave me some reading material.  I suspect they'll ignore my logic.

		"content": "Nobody believes me when I tell them this, and it feels extraordinarily stupid and foolish to type... but I have a completely irrational fear of 'Void' in 3d games.  Paralysing, gripping, nervous-twitching fear.<br /><br />You know in first person shooter games when you can run up to the wall, and the texture gets all pixelated?  That sends shivers up my spine.  Know how you'll be targetting something down a hallway and you strafe against the wall, so that entire plane gets kinda close to the camera?  I tense up.<br /><br />You know how occasionally an object will be move-through-able, either by accident or cheat?  I have real issues with that.  It looks solid, I get nervous when I get close to it, and then suddenly part of it is invisible, and I can see through to the blackness/glitchiness/nothingness beyond?  I literally freeze up, sweat a little, get all nervous, curse, panic, etc.  <br /><br />If I anticipate it coming, like my racer/character/whatever is careening towards a plane of water, and I know that below it is nothing but inky blackness, I'll turn my head to the side, look away, or just close my eyes until I've respawned.<br /><br />I get anxious if I have to go underwater, too, because that's a common place for cameras to get all buggy and clip through walls.  Like if my player is below water, but the camera is sitting above the water, staring at a pixelated, undulating set of polygons about 3 virtual inches in front of the camera, I tend to set the controller down and leave the room.  I can't handle it!  <img src=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-offended.gif?ttinline=true\"/> <br /><br />Let's not even discuss what happens when enemies rush towards the screen--melee attackers in first person shooters--or just towards my characters--sharks and biting monsters in platform games... I yell every time.  Even if it's a happy faced monster, or an NPC in a game who's just approaching in a hurry.  If they get close to the camera, I freak out.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />One of my friends still teases me because I couldn't even beat Serious Sam on \"Tourist\" mode.  (For those who don't know, Tourist mode is the easiest difficulty--your character regenerates 2-3 health per second, and no monster attacks for more than 1 damage at a time... the only way to die would be to get surrounded and beat on for nearly half a minute, without making any efforts to fire your weapons or move.)  I got approached in a dark hallway by a melee monster who got all up-close-and-personal with the screen, got up from the desk, and left the room.  <img src=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif?ttinline=true\"/> <br /><br />I suck.  But there's a deep-routed belief in me that whatever lurks in 'the Void' is a very real, dangerous thing.

It's especially bad in levels where the water's continually rising and I have to keep my character above water or it'll drown. I fail to complete games because of that.<br /><br />I wonder what causes that fear?"
