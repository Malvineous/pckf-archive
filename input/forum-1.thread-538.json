Enter the level and die inside, and you should be inside the wall. Move right and you'll be outside!! Now go up to the yellow in the upper left corner and somewhere should be an elevator. Well, actually, you just walk into nothing and it makes the sound of an elevator opening and the game will crash!<br /><br />If you press up while falling down on that platform in the shrine area of level 1 of Keen 4, you'll go through a fake door to the exit!<br /><br />Know any more?[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v609/genius314/picturekeen.bmp[/img]"
