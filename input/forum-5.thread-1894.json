While I am really satisfied with the outcome of it so far, I am worried that this might not fit the \"Keen 64\" idea as Jimmy James confirmed that notion. <br /><br />So I thought I would ask you guys, the Keen community which path I should take. This is not a question of lazyness and I am more than capable of going more detailed, it's question of direction. I made an image which has a comparison of the 2 different styles so it's easier to decide and see them side by side:<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/Tirqin/Compare.jpg[/img]<br /><br />Detailed: Rest of the Keen art would be upgraded to fit the examples so far. Changes however would only be textured based, keeping the simple low poly look. Complete re haul would not be implemented till the full version of Keen 64.<br /><br />Simple: Current Keen and future Keen 64 art would remain in the same style as the upcoming demo."

Of the two presented, the yorp on the left is definitely the best.<br /><br />The can definitely looks great though. I would definitely keep that in place of the one on the left.<br /><br />The yorp's mouth looks awkward, like it's on its chin or something. Also, it needs to be more like o-D&lt; than o-)&lt;. They have a silly grin, not a content smile.<br /><br />Definitely try cel-shading if you can. It is by far the best way of conveying the classic, bright, cartoony atmosphere of the Keen games."

It is by far the best way of conveying the classic, bright, cartoony atmosphere of the Keen games.[hr][/quote]<br /><br />Cel-Shading is possible (but time consuming) but I believe it wouldn't be well suited, to me Keen 1-3 had more of a semi-realistic look. Cel-shading would work best with Keen 4-6 as it's more stylized. In my honest opinion.<br /><br />Ok, after Spleen mentioned the Yorp's mouth, I made it more like the previous Yorp's mouth as everyone seemed to like that better and it doesn't look as odd now. I also took out the contrast in both the Yorp and ground tiles.<br /><br />So I updated the model comparison, you can see the new update in the original poll picture or [img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/Tirqin/Compare.jpg[/img] (if it looks like the old one, press F5)"
