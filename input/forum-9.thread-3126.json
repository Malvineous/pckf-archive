(And for those who don't know about this: Nothing obviously happened..)<br /><br />After that I haven't tried anything, I've partly lost my interest in relationships. I don't care anymore, naturally it'd be nice if I had some female friend, but since there is none, well, then it is so and that's it. If some female wants something, they can come on and talk to me, but personally I won't bother doing anything to start anything.<br /><br />And have I had a new crush or something? I'm sorry to say 'yes' and I'm kinda embarrassed of myself having such feelings because I know they're completely pointless for me. On a way it's kinda sad to think that I'll probably never see (visually) this cute girl again after getting outta high school in few months. But whatever.

The advice given was a simple question to ask yourself: \"What's worse - Rejection from a person, or the regret of not knowning?\"<br /><br />I think I might be paraphrasing that a bit, so it doesn't have quite the effect as it did when I heard it. <br /><br />I think the exact same thought as you, KR. Just wait a while, then you'll get too lazy to even bother caring about anyone. Then you won't have to worry about any relationship problems.<br /><br />Simple as that.
