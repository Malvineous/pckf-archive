		"content": "I guess Miscellaneous is the only place this topic will fit.<br /><br />Recently, I've been researching and testing new solutions for a next-generation version for my website (from crappy HTML table layout to floating and other creepy words). More recently, I've been experimenting with XML. I'm using an external CSS (cascading style sheet) to define and display the XML. For a language that is basically based on nothing, my first tests look surprisingly well.<br /><br />To the question: What is a good way to seperate elements in XML? In HTML it was line breaks at first, paragraphs later on. But in XML, I've had to make this virtual &lt;block&gt; tag (that I made up, that's what XML is all about I guess) which is probably messed up. Then I gave that box a height bigger than the contents I put in it (a title and some button links). However, using this method means I have to define the height and any changes I make must include adjusting heights to stop things from stacking on top of each other. I'd like to find a method that will either allow me to define some space once, like margin-bottom but that didn't work, or basically add something  to make each &lt;block&gt; skip a line between each other.<br /><br />Yeah my words are vague. Here is the source:<br /><br /><b>XML FILE Untitled2.xml or something. yeah I'm lazy</b><br /><br />[pre] &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=\"text/css\" href=\"xml2.css\"?&gt;&lt;xml&gt;&lt;block1&gt;&lt;text1&gt;Alec's World 4.0&lt;/text1&gt;&lt;menu&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;link1&gt;News&lt;/link1&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;link1&gt;Home&lt;/link1&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/menu&gt;&lt;/block1&gt;&lt;block2&gt;&lt;text2&gt;This is a sample XML document. It uses CSS to interpret the XML and convertit to readable HTML. XML allows freedom from long and confusing markup and allows more possibilites forany web page.This page should include tests of SVG graphics when Firefox 1.5 is officially released.&lt;/text2&gt;&lt;/block2&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;[/pre]<br /><br /><b>xml2.css</b><br /><br />[pre] xml {background-color:#00CCFF;display:block;margin:20px;width:760px;******}block1 {display:block;height:60px}block2 {display:block;height:auto}text1 {background-color:#FFFFFF;border:2px groove red;font-size:45px;font-variant:small-caps;font-weight:bold;opacity:0.5;******;width:auto;float:left}menu {float:right;width:100%;padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none}text2 {background-color:#FFFFFF;border:2px groove red;opacity:0.5;******;width:100%}link1 {float:right;width:6em;text-decoration:none;color:white;background-color:purple;padding:0.2em 0.6em;border-right:1px solid white;font-weight:bold;text-align:center}link1:hover {background-color:#ff3300}listbr {list-style:none;margin-left:0;padding:0}[/pre]<br /><br />I am willing to forget css and learn xsl if I have to use that, but I have a feeling that there is something I'm overlooking.<br /><br />To test the code, have both of them saved as their filenames and load the xml file into a browser. I used Firefox to test, will try IE a bit later.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for reading all that &gt;&lt;.<br /><br />EDIT: When I first previewed, there were a million keen smilies in the CSS code mocking me.[center][img]http://members.cox.net/aborlan/sig/sigpng.png[/img]<br />Crisp Grayscale Signature! 2152 bytes!<br />[/center]"

If I want an exact colour I used to fire up Paint Shop Pro (or now GIMP) and copy and paste the hex values out of there.  Given that a good web page only has a handful of colours in the CSS code at the start and that's all, it's not a big deal.<br /><br />The only problem when you don't use something like Notepad is that you don't force yourself to learn it.  If you have to go look things up yourself all the time then although it takes a little bit longer you do learn *much* faster."

		"content": "Hi there najawa,<br /><br />There are too many websites that have neat charts with colors and hex values you can use for your webpage.<br /><br />there's plenty of them out there, but just choosing a random one I found this, which you can print out if you have a color printer:<br /><br />[img]http://www.ilovejackdaniels.com/colourchart.png[/img]<br /><br />there's better ones, but it's fairly straightforward. Back in the day, when I didn't know what colors to choose, I just made up a hex value. Then you can just test it out by yourself and see what looks good.<br /><br />note that some colors (I believe the 216 \"web safe\" colors) have their own names. most of them are probably straightforward, ex. red, blue, yellow, green. then theres probably some like cyan, teal, dark purple, who knows. you'll have to find out by yourself.<br /><br />a trick for you najawa, if you decide to use notepad to make HTML, the first time you save the file, load into a web browser (Firefox, IE, etc.) to see how it looks. then when you edit it some more and save, you can just refresh the page to see your new changes. I assume that's what xtra and people do when they don't feel like using Dreamweaver or some other program.<br /><br />Also, a tip, put attributes in quotes, ex.<br />[pre] &lt;font color=\"blue\"&gt;Text&lt;/font&gt; and not &lt;font color=blue&gt;Crap&lt;/font&gt;.[/pre]<br /><br />Not using quotes will still usually work in your browser, but it's better coding.<br /><br />Yet another tip, use this: [url=http://validator.w3.org/]validator.w3.org/[/url]<br /><br />It can tell you if your html is valid html or not, as well as help to point out dumb mistakes that can happen sometimes when you're coding.<br /><br />Hope I've taught you something...[center][img]http://members.cox.net/aborlan/sig/sigpng.png[/img]<br />Crisp Grayscale Signature! 2152 bytes!<br />[/center]"
