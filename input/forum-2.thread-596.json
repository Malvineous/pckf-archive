		"content": "Hi! this is my first post on this forum.  I have been a fan of the Keen games(especially 4) for as long, as I can remember.  <br />  So, recently I have gotten back into them and played them all over and over again.  I played them until I wanted more and more of them, but, of course, 7 was cancelled!!![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-redeyes.gif[/img] <br /> But luckily, I even more recently found this site and all the other great Keen sites and mods!!!  <br />  So, to make a long story short, I'm gonna try my hand at modding.  I can't get modkeen to work on my computer, so I guess I'll use Keenmakeover.  It's gonna be really simple since I just got it, and this is my first one, so don't expect anything too nice(in fact, expect something bad![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sick.gif[/img] )  If I enough time (with all my homework and such) I should have it done in about a week!  Thanks for all the great mods, don't bother with mine[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] !"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br />To note, modkeen and Keen MakeOver are completely different programs. With modkeen you can edit the sprites and tiles (graphics), and with Keen MakeOver you can edit the levels. So, modkeen is vital. But to be honest, Keen MakeOver isn't good program at all. It has many flaws and bugs. It crashes often etc.. I'd suggest using KeenWright (usually called KeenEdit) by adurdin. It's the best editor out there in my opinion. You can download it here:<br />[url=http://dosclassics.com/download/190/dl]dosclassics.com/download/190/dl[/url]<br />As for modkeen, try to get it working. What does it say, when it doesn't work? You may be giving it the wrong input.<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"
