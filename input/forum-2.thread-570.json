I was referring to the cleanness of line which they possess. They don't try to do too much. That's a nebulous pronouncement, so feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />I do agree that a whole level of tiles like that would be a little dull. By all means, spiff them up. I didn't mean to suggest that you should limit your tiles to only a few colors.<br /><br />The most complicated tiles in an isometric game that I can think of are either in Activision's Pitfall remake or in Jazz Jackrabbit II. They're probably the most complicated isometric tiles ever. <br /><br />It's interesting that games using the isometric platformer view don't usually seem to complex tiles. I wonder why that might be.<br /><br />When I think of Keenishness I generally think of an environment that I could see a classic 4-6 (or 1-3) Keen in. So that tends to indicate a bright and clear color palette. If you were to make your Keen sprite in a fitting style, a dark and florid environment might be just what the doctor ordered.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/YorpEye.png[/img]"

I just deleted it after beating some boring levels that I don't want to play again.<br />IMO the greatest platformer for PC (except Keen series) is JJ - much more fun, addictive and so on.<br />And captain claw what? Except from giving us a good graphics (not in all the parts) it doesn't offer much. I even like cats being pirates, but this \"thing\" offers boring and hard gameplay, really poor music and sound effects and 0 replay value. Even Lomax is more addictive and fun.

I wish I did.<br />Creating depth means you have to draw things a bit smaller that are further away, but in isometric fake 3D view this doesn't always work.<br />I've created a template for the tilesets with every possible tile in it. The template is very simple, the tiles are plain blocks with a different color for every side. When I create a new tile, I start drawing it above the template tile.<br />For continuous tiles (like the side) I made the first tile, and then copied only the outer 1 pixel box next, above and below it, and drawn the other tiles too. When I had to change a pixel from the original box, I changed it in every other tile too.<br /><br />I can't think of anything else at the moment, and I feel the things mentioned above were obvious too."

It means that I'd have to actually put code and other ideas of other people into my game that may be different from what I've imagined at first. It may make my game better or even known, who knows, but I'd lost much of my independence. This doesn't mean that sometimes I wouldn't accept ideas or even grapics, but open-source is much more than that.<br /><br />When I can work on my game again I'm gonna fix the bugs I've found in the tileset eg.: some tiles are missing, which won't take long to create, but I'm gonna need to make the steep tiles of the tree branch dropdown-able, so Keen can drop through them. This type of block haven't been implemented in the original games at all that's why I haven't thought of it before. Another must is a type of block where I can set it's steepness not just on one side (top or bottom) but on both at the same time. When all this is ready a new enemy will be born which is gonna need some challenging coding at last and an enemy design too.<br /><br />Just one question before I go so I can read the answers when I return: do you like the style of the tileset if I leave the tiles as they are? Some of you said about it in an early stage that it doesn't go well with the keen sprite I already have. How about that now? I know I said that I'm gonna make the tiles high-color, but I start to like what I've done. Maybe I can add a few more colors here and there, but that's all I'd do. What do you think? Another option is to make the Keen sprite a bit more \"pixelated\" with less colors but does it need to change?"

They fit with the detailed Keen just fine.<br /><br />I noticed a little bug on the platform that goes all the way to the left side of the map just above where you start.  If you walk left at this edge you start to leave the map and then are transported back to where you started.  Perhaps pretending any block off the map is a solid movement stopper would be any easy solution.  I think some of the keen maps had extra blocks around the edge of the map that had the \"solid\" property but the view manager would try not to show.  You can see what I mean in keen 6 on the Keens Ship micro level at the start.  Pogo jump/pull yourself up into the offscreen hole in the wall on the right of the screen.  After you fall down, save the game while you are still offscreen.  Now load that game and you will see the hidden blocks.  You probably know how to fix your code better than me though [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />I also had something weird happen when trying to jump from the falling platform to the moving one.  I think I just touched the moving platform and then Keen sortof floated up and left into blank space like he was riding the platform even though he wasn't!  I couldn't replicate it though.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for the full sized levels!"

The main reason for uploading this image was to show you the new kinds of blocks I had to make in order to be able to create some effects I had in mind. For example there is the \"tree\" branch which can now be sloped while the player is still able to drop down on it. It works... almost [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-oops.gif[/img]  Sometimes Keen just falls through it without reason, when jumping and falling down. This doesn't happen most of the time but it is still frustrating.<br />Another type of block I have now is the one used on the steep planks. Look at the third block in the list (at the right side of the picture). That block is steep at it's top and at it's bottom side at the same time. Maybe I'm alone with this, but I haven't seen anything like this in other games. It's not a hard thing to create, but it generated some problems I haven't thought of.<br /><br />I'll start working on an enemy when I have finally managed to work out the problems. It doesn't seem easy though. The whole movement system have to be changed a bit."

It was much easier than I thought [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />There's still the problem of what's-wall-and-what's-ground so the game can decide which platform is ready for grabbing. It worked fine with the old blocking tiles, but eg. the plank's edge could be grabbed too and it's not a full block now as it was before. When I only had full blocks and blocks that had one side as a slope, the choice was easy, but now the new kind of blocks should be grabbed too when they have a flat surface, not just the full ones. This is a bit technical and you may not understand this at all, but don't worry, I do! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] <br /><br />I haven't seen sloped ceilings in Keen 4 even though the tileset contains them, and there's no such thing in Keen 6 either (as far as I remember). Keen 5 had them, but only when there were no need for too narrow walls. I think I have solved my problem, but it may return for some of the enemies, when I have them. If they are too fast or too big my engine may not work correctly, but I still have to try that when the time comes."

Kinda like those animations where a magnifying glass moves over the screen and enlarges everything behind it.  You could just enlarge everything behind the Shikadi in the same way.  That would look pretty nice."

		"content": "Not that I can talk about actually finishing anything yet, but here's what helps me when I get that sick of working with no results feeling. (And wanting to just go do some other project.) Maybe it can prove useful to you:<br />Create (write or type) a list of all the things you can think of that need to be finished. Only list the \"big\" things. For example:<br />- Draw enemy sprites<br />- Program enemies<br />- Draw tiles<br />- Create levels<br />- etc.<br />Now pick from this list what you want to get done first. Break that item down into a more detailed list. Keeping picking an item and breaking it down until you have a list of specific items that you can realistically check at least one item off each time you work on it.<br />It seems to help to have something I can look at and say \"Aha, I'm that far along. Cool, I'm making progress!\"<br /><br />As to the Shikadi effect, yes this would be fantastic. Unfortunately, in the scope of a 2d platfrom game, without using a 3d api (OpenGL for example), it probably isn't realistic. It would be a problem of performance.<br />A much simplified explanation, if you care:<br />In a 2d engine, you're typically working with all of your graphics on the video card, as pictures. To put these on the screen, it is a lot like just pressing a peice of paper on the screen. That paper just gets put on top of everything, it doesn't get to take a look at whats behind it. BUT this sort of process is VERY fast.<br />For the Shikadi effect, you're asking that paper to look at whats behind it. Taking a look at what is behind is a VERY SLOW process. Plus you're changing things based on what is behind. It can be done, but trying to do that along with everything else, at least 30 or 60 times per second is asking quite a lot.<br />A 3d engine does its drawing in a fundamentally different way. Instead of giving the screen a picture, you tell the video card \"here are the shapes that are visible, here's what they are covered with, and here are some distortion formulas that should be applied\" and let the video card assemble all of that.<br />The distortion formulas are the key to the Shikadi effect."

Lucky LL was here to explain things [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]   My point was just that if you download a game with MP3 music your only choice is to listen to the MP3s.  If you download a game with MIDI, MOD, IMF, etc. music - generally anything that stores the actual notes in the song then it's much easier for someone to find out what those notes are, if they want to e.g. learn to play the tune on a piano, make a remix of your song, etc.<br /><br />Like Naj says, MP3 \"keeps people from screwing your masterpiece\" but IMKO having people create remixes and things is half the fun - we all like the remixes of the Keen music, right?  They would've been a lot harder to create if the Keen music was MP3, WAV, OGG, etc.<br /><br />Personally I think the best format for a game would be one of the MOD formats (S3M, XM, IT, etc.)  These combine the \"niceness\" of having the notes available for people who are interested, yet you get to include your own tiny software synth to play the songs, so they're guaranteed to sound the same on any PC.  Plus 300-500kB/song is a lot smaller than an MP3 of comparable quality."

On the other hand, they're less general and flexible than mp3, since they're note based, so they sound worse in some ways.<br /><br />Z-1, I'll send along those mp3s.

So DirectX 10 still supports all the features of DirectX 1.<br /><br />To get to older implementations of particular methods (functions), you need to be explicit in what version you want. However, in the case of DirectDraw functions, there are no new functions, so the old are used and there's no need to \"be explicit.\"<br />Now what I don't know about is what happens if you use a later DirectX SDK and compile using features only available in previous versions. (It should work, but you may need to add flags to tell the compiler exactly what you're doing.)<br />In my case, I'm using the DirectX 7 SDK (the last one with DirectDraw). But don't get too worried. I have DirectX 9 installed so I can play new games. The SDK is only used by the compiler. Don't know how hard it is to get older SDK's, so if you need a copy, let me know and I'll put one up.

If so then there's a bridge - if not, it's blocker tile...<br /><br />if it's a blocker-tile then the foreground-tile is just XORed with 0x001F.<br /><br />if it's a bridge the following piece of code is executed...<br />[pre]     for( word curY=newY; curY &lt; (newY+2); curY++ ) {        word offset = map_line_start[ curY ] + newX;        /* loc_1614, loc_1615, loc_1616 */        word *tile_pointer = maplayer[1] + offset + (curY != newY);        /* loc_1617, loc_1618 */        startX = newX  (curY != newY);                                /* loc_1620 */        for( word curX = startX; curX &lt; level_width; curX++ ) {                 foreground_tile_2 = *tile_pointer++;                short delta_tile = p_maphead[3942+foreground_tile_2];/* tile_fg_animlist[BX] */                if( delta_tile == 0 ) /* nothing to change */                        break; /* next run in outer for-loop */                foreground_tile_2 += delta_tile;                sub_490( &amp;foreground_tile_2, 1, curX, curY, 1, 1 ); /* change tile */        }}[/pre]<br />(my interpretation of the asm-output)<br />sub_490 changes a tile in the maplayer and refreshes the output  to the screen...<br /><br />I hope this helps a little bit...<br /><br />MfG<br /><br />[hr]<br /><br />Hi again <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/> <br /><br />ok, I'm unsure if u already know the format of the map-files, but if u need some info's here whe go...<br /><br />The engine normale uses two files for the maps: \"maphead.???\" and \"gamemaps.???\" where \"maphead.???\" just contains 100 offsets (datatype: long, 4byte) for the level-header's in \"gamemaps.???\"<br /><br />struct of levelheader:<br />[pre]  struct mapheader {  Sint32  layer_offsets[3];  Uint16  layer_length[3];  Uint16  width, height;  char    lvlName[16];  /* ted-level-name, not shown in game*/  char    sign[4];        /* signature: \"!ID! */}[/pre]<br /><br />layer[0] is the background-layer (only not maskable tiles)<br />layer[1] is the foreground-layer (only maskable tiles)<br />layer[3] is the info-layer (the first of the maskabel tiles, contains enemys and some infos like target for doors and so on...)<br /><br />every layer_offset[] points to the place, where a layer is stored... each layer is compressed twice: first u have to uncarmacize them and after that u have to unRLE them.<br />the first two bytes contain the 'uncaramacized' length of the plane and after 'uncarmacizing' the first two bytes contain the 'unRLEed' size (which has to be width*length <img src=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif?ttinline=true\"/>.

So I guess my system is Keen: Next ready :P.<br /><br />I remember that with my old GeForce 2 MX 400 I've got approx. 150 FPS.<br /><br />Btw even with this card, I've got terrible performance with Heroes 5 beta (one of the games that made me to by this card). Although it's a beta and it's not optimized, I guess I'll have to buy some more RAM.----<br /><br />[img]http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/1923/untitled116qa.gif[/img]<br />Tough Bloogs eat princesses"

An option in the game to switch the refresh rate 65-75 Hz would be useful for people with these problems.<br /><br />I have the same with this monitor, actually.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Sorry to say, the program asks for the Allegro 4.0 DLL. I downloaded 4.2 (found out too late lol), and it still didn't work because apparently I need some sort of Visual C 8 DLL too.<br /><br />Include DLLs next time please, even if they're just in a seperate zip to save on download speed for 56k'ers...___________________<br />DaVince, Yet Another Amateur Game Creator! :P"

It's version 4.0.1.0! And for me it didn't ask for anykind of Visual C dll, maybe it requires Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes installed and you haven't installed those?
