Changing levels wasn't too hard, and changing music was somewhat understandable, with WDC... but for some reason I couldn't do both at once.<br /><br />Though rumor has it that Zero X. Diamond is leaps and bounds ahead of us all, on this front... *suspense*"

This will produce a new AUDIOHED.CKx and AUDIODCT.CKx, which you'll need to patch into the .exe file (no doubt by using CKPatch.)<br /><br />As far as I'm aware Wolf3D uses the same format, so I'd be surprised if that editor didn't work.<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"
