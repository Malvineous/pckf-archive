No driver updates to download, no complicated 42-key configurations to toy with, no patches, no unfair advantages for certain players because they use a higher resolution.<br /><br />With a console game, I can get some friends together, plug in the controllers, and play a game which is on a reliable set of hardware.  :-)  I like that."

I would have voted PC for keen, but if you are talking about games, as in what games I like best (discluding Keen, cause that would throw the counter):<br /><br />Worst to best:<br /><br />PC - Graphics usually are poor, and to control a complicated game, you use lots of keyboard keys<br /><br />Cellphones - Although fun, they are not that lastable, and the games are small<br /><br />Vidoe (via TV) - I like the ones where you move your sword, and the sword on the screen moves 2<br /><br />Video (consol):<br /><br />PS2 - Some great classics, but has a visibally poor resolution (I played Star Wars III on an X-Box, and then started playing PS2, and my eyes hurt cause the graphics were so poor compared to X-Box)<br /><br />GAMECUBE - I love metroid prime!!!<br /><br />X-Box: Best graphics, outstanding games!!!

The reason the graphics on your computer are bad is probably because you have an off-the-shelf Dell (or some other Dell-alike brand) with onboard graphics.
