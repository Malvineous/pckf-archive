Admittedly I've had to cut back to 1600x1200 recently (my second monitor is in pieces on the floor until I figure out what was making that sparking noise) but a common symptom of bad web design is that the page will only render correctly at a certain resolution.<br /><br />You should use relative widths, like 50% or 100%, so that elements in your site design will adjust correctly regardless of the screen resolution.  Don't you find it annoying when you come across a window that you want to make bigger, but the program won't let you resize it?  Don't let your website suffer from the same problem [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"
