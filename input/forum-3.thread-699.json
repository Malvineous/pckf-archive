After much procrastination on my part, now seems like a good time to make a forum topic about it.<br /><br />I would like to know what you think of the idea, if you have any suggestions for topics and such, and what kind of show it should be overall. Any thoughts?------------------<br />www.ericmushroomwilson.co.uk My website is going to go back online <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br />[url=http://ericmushroom.livejournal.com/]My stupid journal thing[/url]"

This is the sort of idea that would have worked very well back in the 2001-2004 period, when the community was much more active, but I'm not so sure that it would be successful now. Of course, I'm still willing to help out if there's enough interest.[url=http://toxicsheep.com]toxicsheep.com[/url] | [url=http://commanderkeen.org]coming up next...[/url]"

The other problem, I think, with a news-based Keen podcast would be that the Keen fandom seems to be pretty centralised to this forum (I think...).
