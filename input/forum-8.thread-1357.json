We all were waiting for a possible release of CK 7-9.<br /><br />But really, I think it's next to foolish to hope for the releases now.  I mean, this largest fan forum, and it's not even really active.<br /><br />Meh, I dunno.  I long predicted PCKF would die along with it CK7-9, but it's rather depressing to see it.<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smoke2.gif[/img] <br /><br />(This is half about PCKF and CK7-9, so I couldn't figure out where to put it so put it here, lmao)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

Yes, it has been more active in the past, but is that not the case with all boards? We have lost members, and gained members, and those that remain are diehard Keeners to the core. This board may have quietened down, but now it is stable, like a star that has gone nova and is settling down to billions of years of white dwarf shinning. We do not struggle on, we do not endure, we flourish.<br /><br />I have looked apon dead boards, I have even seen two of my favourate boards collapse, seen the ever more infrequent posts, the members just not logging in anymore, the stagnating topics and lonely conversations with the last remainins core of users. I have seen the forgotten sites, the dead links and deleted content, and twice have I participated in that fateful topic 'This board is closing' I have talked to the moderators and admins, or those remaining and agreed that a board is dead. I have been present on the last day, posted my last post and tearfully watched the error screen the next day. And I tell you that the stunk of decay is far from the Keen community. Not when we have such talent producing such wonderful works as the planned movie and comic, the fanfictions and more.<br /><br />Perhaps we will never see CK7-9, or maybe we can substitute XkyKeen4-6 for them. No one who has glanced at the face of a Keen mod [excepting mine perhaps] can say this board is for nought. Even if our board dies and the Keen community sinks into obscurity and deletion, is all that we created, the fanart, the animations, the mods and levelpacks, even if it is all lost, were they for nothing? Did they accomplish nothing? Did they not entertain and amuse us? Does not this board entertain, amuse, inspire and even challenge us?<br /><br />At the end, and everything must have an end, at the end this board still <i>was</i>, and its being changed all of us. That is something that will <i>never</i> be destroyed, no matter what.<br /><br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

This place isn't just about moaning that TUIT was never created, and maybe never will be. It's about reliving the golden era of DOS gaming and the incredible worlds of the Keen universe we've each travelled.<br /><br />Whenever I think of Keen I still get that pang of nostalgia I'm sure we all know, and as long as that's alive, Keen's alive.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />The development of the hardware, and the greater ability to express every idea that flies into a programmers head, mean that game creators have made the new games congested with every technique in their power.
