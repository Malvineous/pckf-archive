It's actually a little perplexing to me why it's so popular, since there's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it...there's lots of other very similar shooters out there.  Honestly, I've seen very few new games that don't just jump off on a previous concept.  Where's the originality in shooting things?  When somebody invents something really super original I'll be excited about it, but other than that I can't imagine being hooked on any new game for more than a month or two.  (\"Interesting\" is very important: I've played a game where, in some levels, you have to fish.  It's unbelievably boring.)[img]http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k284/KeegTech/WarholDopefishPNG2.png[/img]"

I wouldn't play Halo 2 because it looks like it's just a graphics enhancement over the first, same with the 3rd, I'll probably play Halo 4 when the graphics get Crysis level.<br /><br />But to me, Halo has a certain level of \"fun\" that most FPS's don't have, to name I play Medal of Honor AA a TON, it's one of my fave FPS games. But compared to Halo it has a cut and dry gameplay to it, whereas Halo has a little \"bounce\" to it, I don't know how to explain it, but it can just be fun to play, lol.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...those other FPS games are fun. But Halo's fun is different. The first Halo anyways, the other 2 to me look like they could just be summed up by \"more weapons, better graphics\"."

Halo for the PC beats Halo on the console anyway. (As PC is what it was programmed for.)-----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."
