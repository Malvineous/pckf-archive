I'll be working on a final version in the upcoming daylight.<br /><br />During the party, I ducked around the corner to where my cousin, Safari Boy [plug]iamed.com.au[/plug] lives. Conveniently enough. I returned to the Syntax party with his latest track, which he'd agreed to provide for the demo. Out the front was a lad with a ponytail, who introduced himself by his real name. Michael was it? Eh, I don't remember--I was in a hurry to get back to my demo. He told me to make sure to leave the magazine jammed in the doorway so the door didn't lock itself.<br /><br />Anyway, back inside I was sitting there at my laptop coding away, as one of the other sceners made a lap around the room gathering aliases for the greets. Pulling up next to me, I heard Szevvy spelt out. I dropped everything, turned to my left and exclaimed, \"YOU'RE Szevvy?\" The same person I'd met out the front.<br /><br />Craziness. So, I've officially met IRL someone from the PCKF!<br /><br />Now I wanna see a Keen party."
