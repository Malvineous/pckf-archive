		"content": "I've played a couple of levels now, and I have to say it's a waste they didn't release this.<br />I suppose maybe it's true that Shadow Warrior wasn't that popular, even Duke Nukem 3D came right before Quake, meaning it couldn't have reached as much people as it could've if Quake was later, but still...<br />Wanton Destruction was completely finished, they could've just pressed a relatively small amount of CD's for the real fans... they would've bought it.<br />Oh well... I'm enough of a fan of the game to enjoy it now too.<br />I've had some nice memories about this game (and Duke as well of course).<br /><br />See the thread I linked to above; JonoF added how to make a batch file to run both SW vanilla and WD without having to rename the GRP.<br />I didn't know that was possible, but apparently. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br />I also added how to work with different sets of save games, so they don't keep overwriting.<br />I didn't actually test it (yet), but it should work.Retodon8<br />You live, you die, you are remembered, you are forgotten.
