		"content": "I already mentioned this in another topic, but I think it deserves a bit more attention. Last week a team of Jazz Jackrabbit fans released a new version of their Jazz Jackrabbit 1 editor. You may already have seen the previous one, but this one actually is usable. Here are some screenshots to prove our point.<br /><br />[url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcs94/images/screen1.jpg][img]http://www.jazz2online.com/jcs94/images/screen1t.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcs94/images/screen2.jpg][img]http://www.jazz2online.com/jcs94/images/screen2t.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcs94/images/screen3.jpg][img]http://www.jazz2online.com/jcs94/images/screen3t.jpg[/img][/url]<br /><br />Jazz Jackrabbit2 fans don't really seem to be interested, but it took us a lot of time to create this. Which is why I'm trying to advertise it here a bit. Consider it a compliment [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] , I think commander keen fans are more into these older kind of games.<br /><br />Here's the website with a download link.<br />[url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcs94/]www.jazz2online.com/jcs94/[/url]<br /><br />And some nice examples of JCS94 creations:<br />[url=http://www.jazz2online.com/J2Ov2/downloads/info.php?levelID=3903]www.jazz2online.com/J2Ov2/downloads/info.php?levelID=3903[/url]<br />[url=http://www.jazz2online.com/J2Ov2/downloads/info.php?levelID=3904]www.jazz2online.com/J2Ov2/downloads/info.php?levelID=3904[/url]"

I'll give this one a go and hopefully be able to make some levels.<br /><br />The screenshots look enticing. Nice work.<br /><br />--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"

The music file format is known too, and I almost can figure out the sprite structure.A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

The person who's making this is trying to make an open source engine that can run JJ1. He already has figured out the sprite format so you might want to take a look there.<br /><br />I don't know if Szevvy will figure everything out before us. I don't think so. He's using our code and seems to be pretty busy. And I think we're already quite a bit ahead. I haven't seen the latest version of wombat though."
