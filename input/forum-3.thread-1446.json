Hex editing the AVI shows the codec is DX50, so you might need a newer version of DivX.  Or you could try changing the AVI from DX50 to DIVX and see if the version you already have will play it..."

I hope you still have the original models backed up somewhere, as they will probably come in handy one day.<br /><br />I agree about the speed. Things whiz by too quickly (though if you step-through gradually it helps), and it would be nice to see some other details close up, but it's an applaudable prod nonetheless."
