Of course fellow humans are in general [but not always] rated highest.<br /><br />Now I'm not asking what is *idealy* acceptable, which many people would say covers all pain whatsoever, but rather what is *practically* acceptable, for example many people see it quite unobjectionable to torutre fish for hours by thrusting a hook through them then letting them choke to death on land yet only the meanest person would do the same to say, a duck.<br /><br />So... yeah.

Some insects I haven't felt too bad for crushing, for example some annoying mosquitos or whatever. However, I always try to avoid stepping on worms when it has rained, and feel bad if I crush a snail, for example. But couldn't torture or kill any larger animal, such as fish. Perhaps the size of these animals has something to do with it, or perhaps their non-bugginess. I don't like bugs that much, even if I don't want to kill them. However, seems I still don't feel too bad about eating killed animals. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-halloween.gif[/img]  I guess I'd say that killing for the sake of killing isn't acceptable, however, I guess it doesn't matter too much if one crushes a mosquito once in a while.3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be.

What constitutes unreasonable pain, and what actually feels pain?<br /><br />I think it is not keeping the whole perspective to just notice what feels pain.  Plants are still alive, and so are bugs.  Niether of them have brains like animals do, but they are most definitely living creatures.<br /><br />I think, however, that squishing a bug and jumping on dog are not exactly the same thing in that they have different effects.  Dogs feel pain, bugs do not.  You're torturing something as opposed to quickly killing a bug.  *shrugs* I think in this case, pain is what keeps the action from being protecting oneself from annoyance and sadism.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

I do my best to avoid killing an insect, and move it out of the way of danger if I can. I minimise any factors that may put them in a position where they are a menace (ie. dirty plates, crumbs, etc). I also try to rescue drowning bugs if they're still alive.<br /><br />But I cannot spend every moment of my existence making sure I'm not stepping on a creature (who knows how many I'm killing just by walking across my lawn). Besides, they don't live that long, and will probably be eaten by something soon enough.<br /><br />There are times where I will kill a mosquito or a fly, or a spider that poses a particularly great threat to my own wellbeing (ie. whitetails), but I make sure it's an instantaneous death--THWACK! No agonisingly slow deaths by poisonous substances.<br /><br />As Ret says, it's impossible to tell for sure what another being feels. We can only judge from their outside reactions, but plants and bugs don't have such expressive capabilities as us 'higher' animals, so who knows whether pain is excruciating to them as it can be for ourselves."
