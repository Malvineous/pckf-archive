Some places will provide you with nameservers so you don't have to run your own, but for $18 I doubt they would.  The alternative is to get your web host to run these, they'll usually throw that in for free as part of your web hosting package.<br /><br />Telstra probably isn't the cheapest web host out there, but assuming you have a proper web hosting package (not someone's home Internet connection) then you'll be able to log in to their web page and set up your domain from there (they'll also give you the nameserver IPs to put into your Quost account.)"

The domain lists the nameservers as Telstra's, so you could try asking Telstra how to set up domain names that were registered through them.  I suspect when you (or \"Stephen Oakes\") registered the domain, you were given a username and password to log in to Telstra's domain management site.  Log in here, and that's where you'll be able to add hosts.  You'll need to add a host called \"www\" and give it the IP address of your webserver (this is probably the same IP that comes up when you ran that 'ping' thing at St. Laurence.)  If you still can't get it to work, ask Stephen who he contacted to register the domain, and ring those people up and ask them how to do it.<br /><br />I'm still stumped as to why it does work within St. Laurence, though."
