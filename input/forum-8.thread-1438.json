		"content": "Last night I saw some really strange dreams. There were more than these, but I can only remember two of them.<br /><br />The first one was really strange. If I recall correct this is the first dream where is some other Keener(s) than me. Well, here we go:<br />In this dream I was sitting on some sofa or something on some quite big room. The room \"continued\", the place was really big, like library. There was a lot sunlight, plants and modern looking computers all over on some gray lite desks. They had those screens that are those LCD or whatever (those that are all the way sized like not-so-big painting). It looked a bit futuristic. There were other people too, and I'm sure it was some Keen community related thing, maybe some Keen fan meeting? But the crazy thing was that nobody was playing Keen. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img] <br />Anyways, now what happened.. So, I was sitting there, and on a computer quite near there was LevelLord sitting. She looked very bored, and was using mouse very lazily. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  (This is weird, since I have only seen what she looks like in the Lindsey emotikeen [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lindsey.gif[/img]  and some 32x32 picture that was in the first level of Shadow Keen 2 (in case it was LL).)<br />Then there was Ilsoap that came to say something, but I can't remember what. (Crazy that I don't know what he looks, either.)<br />So, because LL looked so bored, I suggested that if she wanted to play some 2-player game. Well, she couldn't hear since she was listening something (Ramms+ein I assume) loud on some headphones. You know when you for example walk on the street, and someone is listening loud on headphones, and you can still hear the music faintly? Well, that it was in this case.<br />So, I went near the computer, gestured that \"may I write something\" and wrote there to the nearest textbox (I think it was some browser's address bar): \"Would you like to play some 2-player game?\" Then she took the headphones and said someting \"ok\" (I can't remember the exact reply, I still remembered it ~1 hour ago).<br />Ok, then in the dream we played some game (which too bad wasn't Keen), which was really nice. It was a bit Wacky Wheels: In the game there was as a player that dog from movie Beethoven.<br />[url=http://www.moviegoods.com/movie_product.asp?master_movie_id=9275]www.moviegoods.com/movie_...ie_id=9275[/url]<br />The dog was driving a lawnmover (impressed by Wacky Wheels). The race was on a very cool track that was inspired from Crash Bandicoot games. The dog could even slide on some pipes or something the way you can in SSX snowboarding games. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  When I finished the first lap, this cool dream ended! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br /><br />The next dream there was something farmer and a cow. The farmer went to something barn and said something \"Is the cow allright?\" or something, and then the cow that was walking on two feet like humans, attacked the farmer. The cow was really werewolf-like; sharp teeth, furry etc.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img] <br /><br />So, very strange. This probably means that I must avoid LL or I'll be killed by a cow when I least expect it.

That place sounds awesome. Strange that there was no Keening taking place...<br /><br />I've never had a PCKB-related dream (at least, not that I remember).

People are constantly whinging about my tendency to do this during class.<br /><br />I'm not adept at generic dream interpretation, so I guess my conclusion at the moment isn't much different from your rather amusing version above.<br /><br />However, if it was me, I'd be wondering why:<br />- I was dreaming of a 'Keen fan meeting' where there's no Keening taking place and everyone's bored.<br />- the dream ended at the end of the first lap in a racing game.<br />- it was immediately followed up with a separate dream of a mutated Vorticon-like creature attacking a <i>farmer</i>.<br /><br />&gt;Commander SpleenCave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />\"Well, at least I can spel worth a damn.\"<br />- http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BillZimmerly<br /><br />JimSoft Lair<br />http://jimsoftlair.tripod.com/"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img]   Anyways, agree, the place was really nice. But too bad, there wasn't even a single pixel of Keen anywhere.

Finally he locked me inside a block and started dancing around to some forgein music. I got so angry I hit him through the floor and then it turned into that spleen thingy from french erotic film.
