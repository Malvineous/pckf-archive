Because of this, you need a different set of rules applied to you than other forum members.<br /><br />1. Post related things (eg bugs in games) in one topic.<br />2. Do not post non-Keen related links. If you think you've found something Keen-related that might be new and interesting, search for it on Google before posting it to see how many sites link to it already. If lots of sites link to it, we probably know about it already. I would tell you to use the ezBoard search function, but it's not very useful. (To say the least.)<br />3. If you have nothing new or useful to add, don't say anything. Just posting \"Cool! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] \" or \"That's bad. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] \" isn't useful, unless you can explain (in detail) why you think it is.<br />4. Roleplaying is annoying, unless you have a refined sense of humour - this is why not many people post roleplays. (We tried to make LL stop, but so far all efforts have failed.) In short, you should not post roleplays.<br />5. Read the forum rules. Re-read them.<br />6. Do not tell people about your projects until you have worked on them for at least two weeks and have something to show for them (like a demo or a screenshot).<br /><br />These aren't all general rules - just rules custom-suited to you. As long as you follow these rigourously, you shouldn't be yelled at too much for being annoying."
