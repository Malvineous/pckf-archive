You will find a little description here:<br />[url=http://tom-games.de/eng/pcbakt.htm]tom-games.de/eng/pcbakt.htm[/url]<br /><br />Scroll down, there is the download link. The under one is the Windows emulation, but this is still only avaiable in German. But you can also use DOSBox to hear the sounds and music. If you play the DOS version, start with PCB.EXE, it will start with English language and works in DOSBox. Have fun, please tell your opinion about the game!

You have to get rid of the evil bacteria and viruses in the microcosm. The character you play is the microbe Mikky. It must inform the helper cells about the enemies so that they can mark and stop their propagation. The sluggish feeder Cells eat the marked bacteria. All as it is in the real microcosm.<br />But Mikky's friends aren't smart as it. So Mikky have to use different items to lead the cells to the bacterias and viruses. And don't forget the time, you'll lose if there are too many enemies, the fever gets up! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sick.gif[/img]    <br /><br />Please give it a try! Good news, Andreas Tofahrn (one of the programmers) told me that it is also possible to use English language in the Windows emulation:<br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]The Emulators will start in German Language per Default. You can change the Language using the Commandline-Parameter E when you start it. Just create a Shortcut of the Exe, Open the Properties and add a Blank and the E after the Application's Filename.[hr][/quote]<br />But of course you can also play the English DOS version with DOSBox. Have fun and please tell your opinion!

After installing English DOS version, simply use \"PCB.EXE\", that works really in DOSBox!
