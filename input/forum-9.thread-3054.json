If you think one of your bands is not included then it's because your band is not big enough (Megadeth, Iced Earth, etc.) or I don't consider them as metal enough (Guns N' Roses, Rammstein, Slipknot, System of a down). I replaced Slayer on the last moment with Nightwish because I don't expect them to get a vote anyway.<br /><br />Also, don't take that metal enough reason to serious, I used to get a small selection of bands.<br /><br />On a last note; I know some of you don't like metal, that's all right with me but you don't need to post about it. -----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamba.nl/storage/view/335/0/sn/Snow_Ball.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.com/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img]<br />Jamster! rules!"

In my opinion Ripper is a dreadful singer I can't listen neither to the latest Iced Earth album nor to his past Judas Priest albums. The guitar riffs are also becoming more and more simple so I have to agree with you here.-----------------<br />[img]http://www.geocities.com/anthalerero/pic/banner_eurovision.jpg[/img]"

I was lucky because it was my birthday and Jon Schaffer's brother was behind me at the show and thought it was cool that I was diggin it, so he introduced me.  I met all of them except Jon himself very breifly... I didnt have many words.   I was a real big fan at the time.  Im not so much anymore.  But yeah!  I was stoked!
