		"content": "Okay, it's been a long time coming, so here at last is the [url=http://www.shikadi.net/utils/xmms.html]first release of my improved XMMS synth[/url].<br /><br />I got carried away again last night and added the ability to seek in IMF, DRO and RAW files (so hopefully that will keep Shadow Master happy, as that was one comment he made during testing) but seeking is still on the 'to do' list for CMF files.  I don't think there are any major issues remaining, but have a look at the TODO file for a list of things that are still outstanding.<br /><br />Again, this is a source-only release for XMMS, so if you're not using Linux you'll have to wait a bit longer until someone ports it to Winamp.  All eyes on Shadow Master [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]   (seriously though, all that needs to be done is a little tweaking of xmms-adlib.cpp and adding a few lines of code to CriticalSection.cpp.)  Please post about it here if anyone does start porting it, and if you run into trouble I'll see how much I can remember from my days of Windows programming...<br /><br />But those of you who can run it, let me know what you think!<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"

What the hell is a HANDLE??<br /><br />I'll try to port it only if there's people interested in a Winamp port, otherwise I'll just concentrate in my game engine. I really can't afford working on two things at the same time. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-oldy.gif[/img] <br /><br />Besides, I'd have to install Winamp under WINE or something to test a winamp port of the plugin, I just can't go back to Windows whenever I need to test a program. It's not the Linux boot/reboot time, but Windows' (15 minutes aprox.)<br /><br />I'll download the source code and build it for my own amusement in XMMS anyway.------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].
