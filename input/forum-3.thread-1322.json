I just realized that with game maker, I made all my graphics disproportional to what looks best on GameMaker.  So right now, I'm really wondering if I should re-make all my graphics.  I know that sounds like a huge task... And I'm not going to lie, it is huge, but honestly, my graphics currently look like crap on GM.  I forgot to measure into effect the blurriness of GM, and that it would create trails for too fast of movement.  I dunno, but I think I may have to. (Not to mention that there's a lot of fun shit I wanted to do, but couldn't at first because GM couldn't handle it until the most recent version of GM came out a few months ago.  Further more, I was having huge resolution problems... meh, I don't really quite have the energy to do it, but I know it needs to be done.)<br /><br /><br />The good news is that, if I do decide to do it, it'll probably keep my interest more focussed for a bit longer... But, it postpones my demo only further.  Also, my graphics would be ten times more kick-ass than they are now.  Other good news is that since I'm getting my facebook account, I'll try to regularly show you guys what's up in my game.

I should have made my graphics larger (Which I intended to do about x4, now only x2), but GM just shits all over that.  It makes them all fuzzy and gross.  And just x2 wasn't big enough...

I can't say as though I'm going to be done with anything any time soon.  So, while it will, hopefully, look completely kick ass... It's going to prolong my fan game even longer --my demo's target date before was to have it released early June or July.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  I've been modelling for some time now, but I've only recently had time to play around with Keen-material. It's great fun to go beyond the basics, because id's monster designs are not only great by themselves, but allow plenty of room for artistic freedom in bringing them up to (more or less) present-day standards.<br />If you need pointers or information regarding the way I work, I'd be happy to provide those."

You can even put a watermark on it, as I just want to see how you do the shading and such, I have no interest in the original texture itself, but in the technique. <br /><br />And if it is too much to ask that's ok, I understand.<br /><br />But if you're alright with all of that, you can send me the texture via email (in however format you'd like to present it) to: lava89 (at) gmail (dot) com.<br /><br />Many, many thanks,<br />LAVA89"
