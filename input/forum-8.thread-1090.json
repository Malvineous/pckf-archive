After that, I kind of vanished, made a very brief reappearance a few years ago (I don't even remember when exactly), vanished again, and now I'm hopefully back here to stay. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />A little bit of background info: I'm 20 years old, I live in Tennessee, and I'm in my third year of college, majoring in music.<br /><br />So yeah, that's me in a nutshell.

I didn't go by Master Inferno back then, I just used my real name (James Swanson). A Keen2 level competition, you say? I've not checked around the other sections of this forum yet...what does this level competition entail?<br /><br />KeenRush: Yes, I'd say nostalgia is the main thing. I was on Facebook one day last week and there was a Commander Keen group with a link to the flash port of Keen 1, and that's basically what got me interested in coming back.<br /><br />Malvineous &amp; LordOfGlobox: I would love to do some remix-type stuff, however I am currently lacking in the money, tools, and most importantly, disk space for such endeavors at the moment. I have a lot of music stuff planned out in my head, but I'm not able to do anything with it right now, which makes me feel about like this: [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img] <br /><br />Also, Malvineous, I played Xargon too.
