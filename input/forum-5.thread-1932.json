(The skeletons, death sprite, and main sprite - do we need any other reason?) 2) Patches well implimented 3) Tricked out lvl design<br /><br />I personally think this is the greatest mod ever... now what do you think?Tough Guys Can Fix There Own Problems!!!<br />[img]http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a371/najawa/Modding/Prisoner.jpg[/img]<br />*Under Self Inflicted Posting Restriction*<br />Visit My site at [url=http://www.najawa.com]www.najawa.com[/url]<br />[url=http://kevan.org/brain.cgi?Najawa]Click Here!!!

I'm not sure what is the best in my opinion, but it (too bad [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img] ) isn't this one.<br />Agree what you said though, the graphics are just awesome, levels cool, et cetera, but this mod has some small bugs and that kind of things that don't look good in my eyes.<br />Overall, the dark Halloween theme just isn't my favourite, although it looks good.<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"
