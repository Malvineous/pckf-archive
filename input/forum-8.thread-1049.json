But seriously, I can't remember ever using more than something LOL, or ROFL, or IMKO (In My Keen Opinion), and I dropped using, as far as I know, all but IMKO, long time ago because I really started hating them. And it wasn't really often. And I really think you're exaggerating a bit there Shadow Master, since I stopped using them _before_ you even joined and I've never used more than only those few, and quite rarely as far as I can see. So especially saying you don't understand anything when I talk that way is strange, for the reasons said above, as I've never used any special ones (I don't even know them!), and they have never been crucial to the post, and you seem to recognize LOL and likely ROFL too, which were about the only ones -- so what you're saying is pretty much a lie or a joke I can't find very funny... This kind of discrediting is pretty annoying, you know.<br /><br />And PS. That long one in my previous post I took directly from some abbrevation dictionary for the sake of example, I didn't know it myself (and can't remember it anymore, either).
