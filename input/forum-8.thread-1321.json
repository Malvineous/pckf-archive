(Try sliding the rope upwards and out, so it's like the camera follows Commander Keen.)<br />More importantly, you have a LOT of frames. MANY of them are unnecessary because they are duplicated to make the animation longer. (For example, the first 20 frames are the same. And I think the full ID Did This frame uses almost 20 frames.)<br /><br />Hmm... okay, that didn't take too long. How about this:<br />[img]http://keen.keenx.com/temp/mod_2.gif[/img]<br />(under 17k, and looping!)"

		"content": "Sorry 'bout that graphix.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what you mean by \"extra green\", but your avatar is automatically stretched or shrunk to 60x60, so maybe you should resize that gif.<br /><br />Sorry in advance for the length of this, but it's useful...<br /><br />I could give you another fish, but instead I should teach you how to fish, najawa.<br />I did that with Gimp. [url=http://www.gimp.org/]www.gimp.org/[/url]<br />Actually, you might prefer going straight to here:<br />[url=http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html]gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html[/url]<br /><br />I don't remember installing that Animation Package, but might be wrong. Install that too if you want.<br /><br />Anyway, install GTK first. Then install Gimp.<br /><br />Put a copy of the image on your computer.<br />Now open Gimp and load that image.<br /><br />Now look at the Layers window. (If it isn't already open, then in the window that has your image, go to the Dialog menu and pick Layers.)<br /><br />The image starts with the layer at the bottom of that list. You'll notice each layer ends with (Xms) (replace) except for the first layer. The Xms is how many milliseconds that frame is displayed. \"replace\" means it completely replaces the frame before it.<br /><br />Just to get used to things, back in the drawing window, select the File menu and pick Save a Copy. Enter a new file name, make sure your file name ends with .GIF and click Save. This should bring up the Export File window.<br />Select Save as Animation, and click Export. This takes you to Save as GIF.<br />It's pretty self explanatory from here.<br /><br />ALSO: For resizing the image, I think you will want to resize the \"canvas\" without stretching or shrinking the drawing. (Meaning it wont get distorted, but it will fit in the desired space.)<br />To do this, go to the image editing window, select the Image menu and pick Canvas Size.<br />Now, by default, this dialog will keep the size relative to the original, but you want to make it 60x60 pixels. So click the \"chain\" next to the  Width and Height boxes. (It will become \"broken\".)<br />After you set the size you want, but before actually resizing, you'll probably want to position the image. Click the Center button, that's probably what you'll want. (You can of course set your own by using the Offset inputs.)"
