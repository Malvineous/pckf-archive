I was not aware of it until now, but it would explain why I like the sound of the language so much [and likewise Ye Olde English, though it likely is not as devoid of such things as German].<br /><br />Hmm... now that I think about it, it could be any fragment of speech spoken long-windedly as such, rather than a particular language, that has that effect.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />The development of the hardware, and the greater ability to express every idea that flies into a programmers head, mean that game creators have made the new games congested with every technique in their power. The basic games behind all this are so blurred that people cant catch up.

Was it Hitler who threw the corpses into the ovens, or set fire to live people? Was it Hitler who shot people just because he felt like it? Performed operations without anasthetic? <br /><br />Hitler was just an ordinary a$$hole who got in charge, The true evil were those who did the work, manned the camps, and peopled the towns. Most of them would have seen the end of the war and remained unpunished. One of the sadder facts of life.<br /><br />I didn't know there were German contractions. They never teach you them in books, thats the problem, if Hitler had put out books teaching German contractions he'd have won the war.<br /><br />A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Mod2.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
