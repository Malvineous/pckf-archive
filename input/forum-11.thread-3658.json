Use this in place of the regular hocus.dat file to convert the Time Tripping episode to a December Holiday look, with santa hats, snow, candy canes and other such seasonal decorations. To play, just put this file into your Hocus folder and select \"Time Tripping\" at any difficulty. You are suggested to make a backup of the original hocus.dat.<br />(This will ONLY work with the full Hocus Pocus 1.1.
