Metallica and Slayer are really metal but Tool and Rammstein more borderline. It's hard to define metal anyway if not impossible but it's still important because one can listen to Rammstein, and Marylin Manson but also to Britney Spears and 50 cent at the same time. Could you call someone who does so really a metalfan? I think not, ask the average Linkin Park about Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath, chances are huge that they can not name one song of them. A metalfan has to have some knowledge of the genre and listen to more then three metal bands. That's my problem with tho call those borederline bands real metal, most of their fans know nothing of the genre and the music itself have big influences by other genre's.

Bruce Dickinson, the guys of Judas Priest, and Ozzy Osbourne do but Dickinson hates death metal and Ozzy is an idiot so the opinions among the big founders of metal differ. But those are their current views anyway, when bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and Judas Priest started they didn't knew they where making or inviting metal because it didn't excist back then.<br /><br />I think you also misunderstood what I'm trying to say. I don't believe in metal as a real genre. Metal in my opinion is a collection of some subgenres that sometimes very little to do with each other but there are some similarities that bind them all together like a spider web. On the borders of that web are subgenres that have nothing to do with the subgenres on the other side, also because they're on the border they're also bound to other music genres that have nothing to with metal. On those borders you can find the bands that you mentioned among some other Christian bands. Because they're on the border theyre also not reprehensive to what's closer to the centre, 'the true metal' or whatever you want to call it. (I hate the term)<br />And that's my point; you won't find much Christian bands outside the borders, real metal fans listen also or only to stuff that's closer to the centre.<br /><br />I hope that's now clear. Closer to the centre youll find very much antichristian feeling, black metal for example is partly just a reaction against Christianity, in thrash metal and death metal youll find a lot of these ideas too. My guess is that 90% of all metal bands that are closer to centre are against Christianity, and 30% really shows that. If its not for the bands then its for the metal fans themselves who also think that way, same wild guesses apply to them. But all right you still have the 10% (or 70% if youre not to picky) so theoretically it might be possible to be a Christian metal fan, but only if you dont interact with other metal fans and Christians."

First I wrote a long explanation, and didn't even finish it completely, but then I realized that I can say my reply in far shorther and more understandable form. That is, that if one doesn't agree with the evil/bad lyrics, it doesn't matter at all even if you are a Christian and listening something like [name of some evil band here]. As xtra said/meant, music itself (the entity that's formed by the sources of sound (singer, drums, guitar etc..)) is meaningless/neutral itself -- it can sound pleasing to ear or not. Vocals are just another instrument. So, it doesn't really matter whatever you listen to.3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be.

From what I've read of the Satanic Bible, there's an interesting philosophy of life to it, but what I've not read but others have informed me about it seems they have a lot of superstitious rituals just like any other religion.<br /><br />I have about four metalish albums in my playlist right now. I'm not sure if Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin and Thornley are classified as Heavy Metal, but I daresay Wednesday 13 is. The rest is mostly punk rock, emo, country and eurodance/electronica."

I'm not too familiar with that particular genre, so I can't give much information beyond that.<br /><br />Harsh vocals do show up in other varieties of metal, though, but they're usually different in style than metalcore's. Death metal tends toward a more guttural, growling sound, while black metal usually has raspy, higher-pitched shrieks. Other metal genres generally use clean vocals, but there are exceptions (and there are death and black metal bands that use clean singing as well).\"A man is the less likely to become great the more he is dominated by reason: few can achieve greatness - and none in art - if they are not dominated by illusion.\"<br />--Mr. Doctor"

V is by far the most orchestral and symphonic, every song on the album is a masterpiece in my opinion, but, while it does have its heavy points, it is not nearly as metal as their other albums.<br /><br />The Odyssey has a number of pretty good and heavy songs, one amazing ballad (The Accolade II), but it shines on the 24-minute epic titled the same as the album, which is very orchestral and heavy at the same time, probably Symphony X's best song ever written.<br /><br />The Divine Wings of Tragedy has many great shorter metal songs (5 - 8 minutes or so) and a pretty good epic.  Not a bad or boring song on this album really.<br /><br />Paradise Lost is probably their heaviest album, mainly because the singer does a lot of singing that is more growly than in the past, and while I have not gotten into it as much as the three albums listed above, it certainly is representative of how awesome the band is.[url=http://spatang.com/ck][img]http://spatang.com/ck/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [url=http://spatang.com/cosmo][img]http://spatang.com/cosmo/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [url=http://spatang.com/nukem][img]http://www.spatang.com/nukem/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [img]http://spatang.com/scrobblersig.php[/img]"
