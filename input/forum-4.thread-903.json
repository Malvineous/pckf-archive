		"content": "Well, the game's in the mail, and it's on its way to Vitamin Zach.  Hope you guys like it once it gets onto the Internet, but I should warn you of a couple of minor problems with the game, resulting from my inexperience in scripting (but these problems are not unavoidable, however):<br />1) There's a glitch with the elevators that if Keen walks off of them while they're still moving, he'll float in mid-air however high the elevator is.  I have no idea how to fix this problem, but some simple ways to avoid this glitch are to always get on the elevators slowly, wait until they come to a complete stop before getting off, and if Keen starts to \"glide\" while they're moving, move him backwards until he's stopped.<br />2) The save system built into the 3D Game Studio engine is faulty in the area of music - that is, the music playing before you load your file will continue to play after you load it, instead of changing to the music of the level that your saved game is on.  Again, I have no idea how to fix this, mainly because I know next to nothing about how this save system works.  The way I got around this problem while playing was that I always saved my game on the map screen, so that the music would change anyway once I entered a level.<br /><br />Other than these two problems, I'm pretty satisfied and happy with the end result (and yes, I have completed the entire game in one sitting several times).  Just hope you guys like it!

		"content": "This does not suck. I just downloaded this and it seems like a pretty well made game. Sure the controlls are clunky but a key mapper would take care of that. Definitely NOT a CK2000.<br /><br />Although there are some MAJOR issues with it. First off is that you can jump on the world map. This lets you completely jump over levels. <br /><br />Also is if you are running and you jump it has the half life thing where you go FASTER for some reason. (At least it seemed that way.)<br /><br />And the third thing I found was \"Wall jumping.\" If you hold down the jump button Commander Keen will continuously jump. Well this isn't that bad but there are some bad parts on the levels (Especially on the invisible walls) where Commander Keen will snag onto a vertex or something and continuously jump, rocketing him into the air. This is especially weird when you fly so high you land on top of an invisible wall and you REALLY fly off into the air.<br /><br />I also got trapped in places where you aren't supposed to be able to go using this bug. Now this isn't TOO BAD of a problem because you can always get back to where you ARE supposed to be.<br /><br />Please note that this was almost all done on the world map and from only 10 minutes or so of testing. I am sure that this would all be solved if you disable jumping on the world map.<br /><br />Anyway. It is still a really awesome effort. Especially from only one person. Seriously I couldn't do something like this even if I would want to try.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://img360.imageshack.us/img360/548/blegdandsmeegnewbanner2wf.png[/img][/url]"

In a platformer game where jumping is important, a flaw such as this can't really just slip under the radar. The jumping makes it just impossible to guess where he's going to land, especially considering the layout of the game.<br /><br />-The layout of the game is horrible. It seems like you sacrificed gameplay merely to stay true to the original. Each level is dreadfully linear for a 3d game. It just makes me wonder 'Why is this even 3D?'. Maybe if at the very least it was from a side-view perspective it would be forgivable, but the behind view makes it impossible to judge where you're going to land. It's all just ridiculous.<br /><br />There's a plethora of glitches. From the camera bug to the platform bug. Plus Keen's walk cycle looks ridiculous, and all of the scenery is incredibly dull. Even if keeping the polygon count is an issue, it's possible to find creative ways of making things look decent. That is not really evident here.[center]<font color=\"MAROON\">TOUGH GUYS DON'T FOLLOW FADS</font>[/center]"

His walking speed is ok, but the animation displaying him walking just is too fast.<br /><br />- Collision is not too good. Slopes are hard to walk on and he automatically falls down from it when you're standing on a slope.<br /><br />- Levels could have been made wider, because now it just plays <br />like the 2D thing, because you STILL only can go forward...<br /><br />- Use the original Keen controls. ctrl, alt, space. If alt doesn't work correctly, use the Z key instead or something. Making keys configurable would be nice too (and maybe gamepad support?).<br /><br />- When defeating an enemy, he shrinks and dies. What happened to the enemy turning into a flower, or, as in the later games, being stunned with stars above his head? Ah well.<br /><br />- It's hard to jump on platforms, because of the too-fast jumping speed.<br /><br />- Some moving platforms stop moving after Keen jumps on them for the second+ time.<br /><br />- The intro screen kinda looked bad. Probably because of the bad mix between 2D and 3D. I'm willing to make a new title screen if you want me to (using the 3D modeling program Blender), which has both the waking up Keen picture and some better fitting 3D text...<br /><br />That's it for now.___________________<br />DaVince, Yet Another Amateur Game Creator! :P"

Yes the game does need improvement, a lot that is. Maybe you should have posted it as a beta and not a final release. Even though the game is linear, i found it to be quite a nice change from the 2d predicessor. A lot of people have said in the past they would rather keep the keen fan games in the 2d era where it blongs, and i kind of feel the same way for it would be sort of weird to see the massive change.  At least it stayed sort of true to the original. I would say dont make this the final release but just a beta. If you can figure out the bugs in your code, such as movement, camera angles, etc, i think this game will be very fun."

Djaser's posted here enough already.<br /><br /><br />I remember the old days of the PCKF when a person would be congratulated for cranking up KMO and simply finishing the task of making a new level for Keen 1.<br /><br />This thread makes me wonder: where the hell have those days gone?<br /><br />If this game were released back then, would we still be complaining about not being able to use the control keys that we would have liked and complaining that the level layouts aren't what we wanted? (I know that some people pointed these things out in their posts as suggestions for improvement - I'm not talking about those people here). <br /><br />Maybe we'd appriciate the game more for what it is - the first 3D Keen game ever. Not what it isn't. <br /><br />Perhaps some of us would be more grateful that a Keen fan has released his years-in-the-making project for us to play, instead of just saying outright that it sucks and even critizing the game (or was it the game's creator?) BEFORE it was even released. I'm talking about you, Allstories.<br /><br /><br />I'm not going to tell Allstories to go make his own game, because like Djaser was possibly trying to say (and if not, I'd hope his 'shut the fuck up' posts actually have <i>some</i> point to them for the language used), you don't need to be able to make your own game to notice improvements that could be made to others' games. (Instead of crying 'ignorants!' he could have explained that in his posts...)<br /><br />Perhaps instead Allstories can go learn what's involved in making a game like this - not so he can make a game of perfection, but so he can understand why some of these so-called bugs and glitches are in the game, and how it's not just a matter of \"Well, Allstories thought 'the layout of the game is horrible'. There. All fixed.\" or \"Allstories thinks the game looks like some shoddy Gamemaker game. I'll just change this and this. There! A commercial quality game!\"<br /><br />That would enable him, instead of just saying it sucks, to explain why it sucks <b>and provide a practical way to improve it</b>.<br /><br />edit: changed a few words around.--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"
