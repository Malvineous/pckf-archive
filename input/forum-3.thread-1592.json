Practically everyone on the board is capable of at least some artistic merit, why just last week my arts teacher said to me 'You managed to fail a test on self expression.

So good ideas, I want more! As well, it's the first time (as far as I know) someone has used treasure eater as character. It makes the Shadowlands feel more alive with those fun facts, like for example the ship they steal \"..from a Council Member who only had a few payments left to pay off on the ship\".
