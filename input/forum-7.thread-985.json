		"content": "I recently found a mod of Keen 4 I was working on a few years back entitled Bob the Temp in \"Casual Thursday!,\" and I've decided to continue with it. However, I suck at pixel art.<br /><br />To give it a certain \"feel,\" I was thinking of having different people do different graphics. I guess I could do the rest, but I was wondering if anyone would be willing to draw a black, late-80s Smokey And The Bandit-era Pontiac Trans Am (you know, like what Apu has in The Simpsons) in Keens 4-6 style to replace the Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket.<br /><br />It's kind of odd, but would anyone be willing to do that?-----------------------------------<br />[url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=izxrocVNVOk]Dnde Esta Jeff?

It's going to be set in a coastal town in the Pacific Northwest, so even if it isn't fun, it should have the nicest atmosphere in a Keen game [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img] .<br /><br />That'd be great if you could try it, KeegTech. Maybe I'll even have you do some more artwork [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] . But anyways, do you want a picture for reference?-----------------------------------<br />[url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=izxrocVNVOk]Dnde Esta Jeff? [/url]<br />Take a look at these hands!

Well, it's back on track now, I have the story done, I just need to fix some issues with the graphics within the 4TXT files and it'll be 5% done.<br /><br />Edit: Fixed for the most part now. I'll go ahead and upload the (now 6% done - I added a title screen that looks like crap) program in a second here."
