It's called 'Joe Cool' and I downloaded it some time back from Bobby Prince's homepage, and I just realised how similar it sounds to the Keen track 'Jazz Me'.  See what you think:<br /><br />[url=http://www.shikadi.net/pckf/jazzme.imf]Jazz Me (.imf)[/url]<br />[url=http://www.shikadi.net/pckf/terrace_joecool.mid]Joe Cool (.mid)[/url]<br /><br />This is what Bobby Prince had to say about Joe Cool:[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]This song was named in honor of Joe Siegler, the \"guy responsible for keeping Apogee Software connected to the world\" (among many more things, including beta testing). It even has words, which I will spare you from :-) This music was supposed to be used in the computer version of the award winning board game \"Terrace,\" but I have not seen the game on the shelves yet.[hr][/quote]"

		"content": "They're both written by Bobby Prince, who likes to do a lot of 12-bar blues in his work.  I'm sure a music theorist like TMST (or anyone else who's into performance) could tell you about that sort of thing.  I'd just chalk it up to the creative juices flowing from the same source--there's bound to be similarities."
