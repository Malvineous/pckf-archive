		"content": "Hi to all.<br />When I was a kid I played all Commander Keen games and I enjoyed them a lot. Now I want to create a Commander Keen game, but a totally new game: new graphics, new music, new levels, new story...<br />I don't like game making programs because all games end being equal between them. For that reason I'll code the engine and the game. But I need some help with the graphics. I have a character drawed, but I'm very bad doing animations and backgrounds. Also, I have in mind some ideas:<br /> You'll control Billy, but also Billy's dad [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]  <br /> They both have a transformation gun, so they can turn into other animals and use new powers.<br /> Maybe the game won't be called Commander Keen, but both characters will use their PogoSticks and guns.<br />This isn't the typical project that ends dying. I'd like to do a commercial quality 2D platform game.<br /><br />Anyone interested?"

The transformation gun idea is nice, I always like that stuff in games (ok, played only one game where one can do that).

I'm not good at all and I personally hate animating sprites.
