There are charities and stuff, you shouldn't be forced to pay SO much extra tax money if you don't want to (seriously taxes aren't very good, especially property taxes.) I wouldn't go for a firing squad, I'd just say they can build up their retirement funds and get money from family.<br />On topic though, I'm not gonna argue (especially with the argument najawa was using)  Arguing with you wont change anybodies minds, and it wont win a debate either.  The reason it won't win a debate is because most of us have a totally different perception of values and truth.  If everyone excepted (as I do) Jesus as the truth (and the Bible and stuff like that,) then I could show you all verses or say things like I've heard before like, \"God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\"  The only thing is, most of you don't believe that, but believe in something else (another religion, evolution, or whatever.)  Therefore, to win an argument, there has to be an all around excepted truth.  I could argue on grounds we all agree on and make a few points (which I won't bother making) but I couldn't win.  Actually, if I weren't Christian and didn't have ANY religious beliefs, who knows what I'd think.  I might hate America, or any thing, i dunno.<br /><br />  If you don't want to read what I wrote, I said I'm not going to talk. Sorry for long post"

In the US at one point, some people got upset because those of european descent and those of any other descent were going to separate schools.  \"Segregation like this,\" said these upset people, \"Should not be permitted.\"  The US Supreme Court disagreed.  \"Segregation is fine,\" the Court said, \"So long as the facilities are equal.\"  It wasn't until fifty-eight years later that the US finally got around to figuring out that separate is inherently not equal.  Schools were integrated.<br /><br />The main thing I want to pull from that is that <i>separate is not equal</i>.  I applaud the fact that same-sex couples in the UK can finally get legal recognition of their union.  Why, though, can they not be legally married?  Same-sex couples now have the same rights as traditional opposite-sex couplesexcept the word.  But what's in a name anyhow?  A surprising amount.  Consider for example a man who has a lot of sex and a woman who has a lot of sex.  The man is called virile.  The woman is called a slut.  Giving the same thing two different names can lead to very different perceptions of the thing.<br /><br />But enough on the UK thing.  Kudos to Canada, the Netherlands, and the other places who in no way distinguish heterosexual and homosexual couples.  I feel somewhat fortunate that my partner is a Canadian citizen.<br /><br />I think that an interesting question to ask might be what makes a marriage a marriage.  Love?  Children?  Strategy?  I'm curious as to what people think, and as to what it is that straight people can do that gays can't."
