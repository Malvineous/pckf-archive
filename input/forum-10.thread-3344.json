Doing a two-album set never entered into our thought process. But when we looked at all the songs we had and arbitrarily tried to choose 'the best' 14 for one album, we realized we had two albums' worth of really great songs.\"<br /><br />With regards to what the fans can expect from the new tunes, Tankian said, \"There has been a great deal of upheaval [and] very troubling times for all of us over the past year or so, and that has brought forth a lot of emotional material. There's a good amount of social commentary in the new songs, as well as songs where we deal with love, reminiscing, relationships, politics and funny experiences.\"<br /><br />SYSTEM OF A DOWN are currently holed up in a Los Angeles recording studio finishing vocal tracks for both albums. Rick Rubin (SLAYER, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, AUDIOSLAVE) is helming the sessions, with help from Tankian. <br /><br />(Thanks: STZ1959) [hr][/quote]<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]SYSTEM OF A DOWN: New Album To Surface In March - Nov. 17, 2004 <br /><br />Launch Radio Networks is reporting that SYSTEM OF A DOWN are looking at March 1, 2005 as the release date for \"Hypnotize\", the first half of their new album. The second half, titled \"Mesmerize\", is slated for a late summer or early fall release. The March 1 release has not been officially confirmed yet by band or label representatives. <br /><br />Contrary to initial reports, \"Hypnotize\"/\"Mesmerize\" will be one two-record set, released in two sections, and not two separate projects. Guitarist Daron Malakian said that the band's decision to issue a double album of new material became a necessary choice. \"Doing a two-album set never entered into our thought process,\" he said. \"But when we looked at all the songs we had and arbitrarily tried to choose 'the best' 14 for one album, we realized we had two albums' worth of really great songs.\" <br /><br />Malakian recently told Entertainment Weekly that the new music \"is more mature.\" He added that among the elements added to the band's sound this time around are \"an orchestra, some obscure Middle Eastern instruments, and 'pure schizophrenia.'\" <br /><br />The quartet are currently in the final stages of recording \"Hypnotize\"/\"Mesmerize\" in a Los Angeles studio with producer Rick Rubin. <br /><br />The new CDs will follow up SYSTEM OF A DOWN's 2001 five-million selling sophomore effort, \"Toxicity\", and its companion disc of leftover \"Toxicity\" tracks, 2002's \"Steal This Album!\". [hr][/quote]<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]SYSTEM OF A DOWN To Spend Next Two Years On The Road - Jan. 7, 2005 <br /><br />SYSTEM OF A DOWN guitarist Daron Malakian recently spoke to Rolling Stone magazine about the group's upcoming albums  \"Mesmerize\", due this spring, and \"Hypnotize\", due this fall  and their plans to spend the next couple of years on the road.<br /><br />Malakian told Rolling Stone that two of his favorite songs from the upcoming CDs are \"Lost in Hollywood\", which he calls \"one of the best songs I've ever written\"; and \"Cigaro\", which opens with a ferocious punk riff as vocalist Serj Tankian sings, \"My cock is bigger than yours.\" Other standout tracks include \"Hypnotize\"'s Indian-seasoned title track and the brutal speed-metal blast \"Kill Rock &amp; Roll\".<br /><br />SYSTEM OF A DOWN's first stop is Auckland on January 21, where they will kick off a six-day stint at New Zealand and Australia's annual traveling festival, Big Day Out. <br /><br />\"We're going out and doing as many shows as we can,\" said Malakian. \"It'll be constant touring for two years,\" he explained. \"Right now, I'm most excited about being with the band onstage, and being behind a guitar.\"<br /><br />(Thanks: ShaunZ) [hr][/quote]<br /><br />And what's more: you can download the new explicit song 'Cigaro' [url=http://www.srcswccbi36.com/CIGARO.mp3]here.[/url]<br />But I think it's pretty bad, so be warned [img]http://images.fok.nl/s/shadey.gif[/img]<br /><br />Links:<br />www.systemofadown.com<br />http://www.systemofadownonline.com-----------------<br />[img]http://members.lycos.nl/holydjaser/signature.JPG[/img]"
