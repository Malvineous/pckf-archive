(link doesn't work right now, check another post below)<br />-----Press SHIFT To Pogo-----<br /><br />Anyone who remembers the old Q90 may recall that I kept promising to create a Goodbye Galaxy-esque engine in TGF/CnC. Well, this obviously never fully materialized as I kept putting it off.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I have, in fact, finished the pogoing part. As Commander Keen Psychedelic was innovative in creating ledge-grabbing, I hereby dub my product Commander Keen Funkadelic, as it has a fully-functional pogoing engine in TGF. This will <b>revolutionize</b> the fangame world. I hope.-----------------------------------<br />[url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=izxrocVNVOk]Dnde Esta Jeff? [/url]<br />Take a look at these hands!
