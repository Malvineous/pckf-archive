Is the statement 'I am lying' true or falseor both or neither. [Trick question]<br /><br />2.) Mortimer has hidden spot and 2 gargs behind 3 doors and asked Keen to choose a door. After choosing Mort opens one of the doors Keen did not choose to reveal a garg. Mortimer asks Keen if he wants to switch his choice of door. If he gets it wrong, Spot will be fed to a rabid KeenRush. Should Keen switch his choice?<br /><br />3.) Keen has a bag of sweets weighing 100 pounds that is 99% sugar. Mort steals a number of sweets and tells Keen the bag is now only 98% sugar. How much does the bag weigh now?<br /><br />4.) Mortimer and Keen are playing a coin flip game to decide the fate of the universe; Keen knows however that the coin is rigged to always show heads 70% of the time. How often should Keen guess heads in order to maximize his chances of winning? [In a normal flip its 50% as there will be half a chance hes right at each flip.]<br /><br />5.) Mortimer visits the Keen forum with $1 and offers to auction it starting at 5 cents and moving up in 5 cent increments. He sells the dolloar to Xky for $6.55 how did he do it assuming no one on the forum wants to lose money?<br /><br />6.) Specify the smallest integer that, requires in order to be specified, more words than there are in this sentence.<br /><br />[intiger, a whole number greater than 0; specify, make sure that only the number is chosen]<br /><br />i.e, specify a number that this statement contains too few words to specify. Can it be done?<br /><br />7.) Keen takes a 99% effective test for a deadly and painful disease that occurs in 1 in 1000 people and is told that the test is positive. Keen calmly walks home as if nothing has happened. Given that the test is 99% effective,  why isn't Keen worried?<br /><br />8.) You paint a sign with 2 buckets of paint, the next day you need to paint a sign three times the size [scaled up 3 times], how much paint do you need?<br /><br />9.) There are two doors, behind one is a sleep deprived LL, behind the other is TUIT. Giarding the doors are Keen [who always tells the truth] and Mort [who always lies] sadly, Mort has cut the power so you can't see who is who. You may ask either guard only 1 yes or no question to discover which door has certain death behind it, what do you ask assuming you have no idea who you're speaking to?<br /><br />10.) Mort challenges you to a shooting game. Each player takes turns to shoot a target until one scores 4 hits. This is counted as a 'game' there are 11 games after which the person with the most won games wins the match. If you are half as good as Mort, what are your chances of winning?<br /><br />Enjoy.

Mortimer asks Keen if he wants to switch his choice of door. If he gets it wrong, Spot will be fed to a rabid KeenRush. Should Keen switch his choice?</i><br />Keen would probably be too busy jumping over/avoiding the Garg to change his choice--in which case not only would Spot be fed to the rabid KeenRush, but the remaining Gargs would leap out and devour him.  Poor Billy.<br /><br /><i>3.) Keen has a bag of sweets weighing 100 pounds that is 99% sugar. Mort steals a number of sweets and tells Keen the bag is now only 98% sugar.

How often should Keen guess heads in order to maximize his chances of winning? [In a normal flip its 50% as there will be half a chance hes right at each flip.]</i><br />He should guess Heads the first time, and ensure that the coin is dropped or otherwise fumbled, giving him a chance to dishonorably shoot Mort in the back--it's the only way he'd stand a chance... although the Mort he's interacting with is probably an android, anyway.  :-)<br /><br /><i>5.)

Specify the smallest integer that, requires in order to be specified, more words than there are in this sentence.</i><br />The smallest of integers; three minus two; five minus four; the first number when counting with one's fingers; the first digit on a telephone; the difference between Mortimer McMire's and Billy Blaze's IQs.<br /><br /><i>7.) Keen takes a 99% effective test for a deadly and painful disease that occurs in 1 in 1000 people and is told that the test is positive. Keen calmly walks home as if nothing has happened. Given that the test is 99% effective, why isn't Keen worried?</i><br />It was administered by a Garg, who lacked proper certification.  Also, Keen was pretty sure he triggered a false positive by the sheer amount of sugar in his bloodstream.<br /><br /><i>8.) You paint a sign with 2 buckets of paint, the next day you need to paint a sign three times the size [scaled up 3 times], how much paint do you need?</i><br />I believe we'd need more information to assess this correctly.  Something about the total surface area of the first sign and the amount of paint held in each bucket.  Either way, I'm pretty sure all it'd take is some Tom Sawyer-esque diplomacy and I could find someone else to do it for me.  :-)<br /><br /><i>9.)

I think?  Not sure on this one.  <br /><br /><i>10.) Mort challenges you to a shooting game. Each player takes turns to shoot a target until one scores 4 hits. This is counted as a 'game' there are 11 games after which the person with the most won games wins the match. If you are half as good as Mort, what are your chances of winning?</i><br />My chances of winning are zero, because I'm his righthand man, so I've got to throw the game, lest I suffer his wrath.  Besides, letting him win boosts his ego, and I get to hear his laugh that way.  Muahahaha.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"

After choosing Mort opens one of the doors Keen did not choose to reveal a garg. Mortimer asks Keen if he wants to switch his choice of door.

Should Keen switch his choice?<br /><br />No. He should walk away (avoiding the garg, of course), and later, when mort has left, come back to rescue spot.<br /><br /><br />3.) Keen has a bag of sweets weighing 100 pounds that is 99% sugar. Mort steals a number of sweets and tells Keen the bag is now only 98% sugar.

You may ask either guard only 1 yes or no question to discover which door has certain death behind it, what do you ask assuming you have no idea who you're speaking to?<br /><br />I <i>may</i> ask a question, but won't.

Can it be done?[hr][/quote]<br /><br />This one is a little baffling. Since any integer can be expressed using numerals rather than words, the answer would have to be, \"There isn't one.\" No number would require more than a numeral to be specified. If you mean the smallest integer that requires more words than are in the above sentence (the first one you state the challenge in -- not the second) to be stated in words, then it would have to be one trillion, one hundred and one billion, one hundred and one million, one hundred and one thousand, one hundred and one. It weighs in at 21 words, two more than that sentence. Unless you count hyphenated words as more than one word (which I flatly refuse to do), then I don't think you can hit twenty words. I used ones since they're small, and hundreds of thousands/millions/billions since the \"x hundred and x\" phrase was the only one which allowed me to pack five words between each pair of commas.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/YorpEye.png[/img]"

[This is the famous Monty Hall problem.]<br /><br />3.) 50 pounds; 1% of 100 pounds is 1 pound, then it becomes 2% of something, 1 pound is 2% of 50 pounds, Mort ate half the sweets.<br /><br />4.) Keen should <i>always</i> chose heads, this will give him a 70% success rate.<br /><br />5.) Mort visits the forum offering an auction, the condition is that not only must the w inning bid be paid, but also the second highest. Thus in order to stop losing money the second highest bidder must raise his bid [so he gets a dollar to help cover costs] Then the 'winner' then comes in second and so on...<br /><br />6.) This can't be done! Note that the sentence is essentially 'name a number that needs more words to name than this sentence telling you to name it has' this is like 'Open this box with the crowbar inside it' or 'Write this whole sentence less words than it needs'<br /><br />7.) If the test is 99% effective, and say, 10'000 people take it, 1% of the healthy people will test positive [100] Of the 10 [1 in 1000 x 10'000] sick people, all should usually test positive. Therefore only 10/110 or 1/11th of the people who test positive will actually be sick.<br /><br />8.) A sign 3 times as large has 9 times the area [3 times taller x 3 times wider] and will thus need 18 buckets of paint. [Only 43% of 16 year olds get this right!]<br /><br />9.) The standard question to ask is 'You are Keen and this door has LL behind it; are both these statements true? Both Keen and Mort will answer 'yes' if LL is behind the door and 'no' if she is not. [Think about it]<br /><br />Xky's question 'Would the other guy say TUIT is behind that door?' works, if the answer is 'yes' then don't open the door, if it is 'no' then do. Good work Xky!
