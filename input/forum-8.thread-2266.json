I seem to have the only copy on the Internet, which can be downloaded at the [url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/keen/spleen/download.html]Spleen Keen Downloads section[/url].<br /><br />It's pure keyboard controlled, and won't function as a core desktop, but it works well if all you want to do is turn the computer on, pick a game and start playing.<br /><br />I haven't erased the database on this copy, so it comes with the same menu structure my 386 first came with. Sheer nostalgia for me."
