All my versions of Keen i got from Beyond the Pogo. Why isnt it working? I know there is music and sound effects because ive seen you all talk about it and ive heard midis. Is there anyway i can fix this? <br /><br />Thanks! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-love.gif[/img]"
