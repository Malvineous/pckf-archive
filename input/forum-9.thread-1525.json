Generally I consume an apple for breakfast. I only really like Pink Lady and Royal Gala, sometimes others if they're sweet enough. Granny Smith and Golden Delicious are too hard/bitter and soft/weird, respectively, and most other red ones don't have much taste to them.<br /><br />I don't really eat many oranges any more, though a couple of years ago I was in the habit of eating one for breakfast... I just found them to be too much hassle in the end. So I just drink a lot of orange juice--only pure, organic stuff though. The stuff you get from supermarket shelves and such is really horrible once you've tasted real orange juice.<br /><br />I don't really eat pineapple by itself either, since large quantities acidify my tongue. Canned stuff doesn't, but I don't really like eating processed fruit--though it's pretty much a necessity when it comes to pizza, of which I consume a fair bit these days.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />A concerned member of the Preservation of Endangered Spleens Society<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
