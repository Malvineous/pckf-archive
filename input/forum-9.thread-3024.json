		"content": "I think having 16 colours to choose from when Keen modding helps me a bit. <br /><br />I am pretty crap at drawing things, and I find that the limited amount of colours to choose from basically decides what colour I should use. Although I can see how it'd be annoying to only have 16 colours when you want to draw something and it needs a non-included colour (while still needing to use all of the first 16 colours).<br /><br />I'd vote 16 - 256. Any more colours than that and I'd be in too far over my head. But that's just my preference when drawing and doesn't have much to do with the actual question.<br /><br /><br />I had a bad experience while playing Space Quest CGA when I was a child, and although the lack of colours in the game had nothing to do with that, I am still 'freaked' (for lack of a better word) by CGA games. So perhaps I'm a bit biased, but in answering the question, I think a great game can be made with 16 colours. Like Keen was."

		"content": "This is real hard to say, it all depends on what you are trying to pull off. If you are trying to make a 3D ultra realistic game then obviously the more you can get the number of colors displayed to the number that humans can see in real life will be better.<br /><br />Now if you are talking about a \"made at home\" dealie it still depends on what style you are trying to pull off. Personally for sprites I prefer to use a limited palette to begin with but I do find 16 colors to be very restrictive. I like to use few colors when coloring but I like to have many shades to start with. Um... understand?<br /><br />But regardless it doesn't matter about the graphics it matters about the game play. This is the fundamental fact that ID fails to grasp. The same reason why Duke Nukem 3D kicked Quake's butt even though Quake had 16 bit color while DN3D had 256.
