		"content": "It's November and the whole year has almost passed. Plenty of new albums have been released and most of us have probably hears some good ones. <br />So as the year is almost closing, what are your favourite albums and can you list them?<br /><br />THIS IS TOPIC IS ABOUT CDS RELEASED IN 2005 ONLY, OLDER CDS OR RE-RELEASES DON'T COUNT. IF YOU DONT HAVNT HEARD ANYTHING RELEASED IN 2005 OR ARE TO LAZY TO READ THIS POST, THEN STAY OUT.<br />(that should be clear)<br /><br />I know that most of you have never heard of any of the bands I am about to post, but hey that's bad for you and not for me.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-gimp.gif[/img]  <br />So I'll kick of:<br /><br />[img]http://metalfan.nl/images/reviews/jpaor2005.jpg[/img]<br />1. Judas Priest - Angel of retribution <br />Great comeback album of a band that hasn't released anything worth listing to in fifteen years. This album is hard and heavy, and worth checking out for any rock fan.<br /><br />[img]http://metalfan.nl/images/reviews/bdsouls.jpg[/img]<br />2. Bruce Dickinson - Tyranny of souls <br />Also a comeback album from the hands of the Iron Maiden front man Bruce Dickinson, who hasn't released anything under his own banner in seven years. Kicks of with some raw lead guitars and keeps rocks till the end despite some weaker moments<br /><br />[img]http://metalfan.nl/images/reviews/dwcrimson.jpg[/img]<br />3. Demons &amp; Wizards - Touched by the crimson king <br />Joint project of Iced Earth guitarist and Blind Guardian front man. Some rough songs with great rhythms but also some nice ballads.<br /><br />4. Grave Digger - Last Supper <br />5. Nevermore - This Godless Endeavour <br />6. Kamelot - Black halo <br />7. Primal Fear - Seven seals <br />8. Iommi - Fused <br />9. Rammstein - Rosenrot <br />10. Gamma Ray - Majestic <br />11. Iron Maiden - Death on the road (live)<br />12. Alice Cooper - Dirty diamonds <br />13. Dream Theater - Octavarium <br /><br />In the end a very good year, I only got disappointed with the new Alice Cooper and was shocked that Dream Theater dared to release an album like Octavarium and charge you money for buying it.<br />-----------------<br />[img]http://jamba.nl/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Rocket.gif[/img]<br />Jamster! rules!"

Not quite as good as his previous album, but still plenty of good tracks to distract me whilst attempting to do my homework.<br /><br />[img]http://81.176.74.183/covers/k/kaiser_chiefs/employment/cover.jpg[/img]<br />2. Kaiser Chiefs - Employment<br />Some rock to lighten the mood. Varying from fast to slow and quiet to loud, this has a nice mixture of different sounds and feelings that make it suited for a variety of different moods. (Goes well with mood swings.)<br /><br />[img]http://81.176.74.183/covers/f/franz_ferdinand/2005_-_you_could_have_it_so_much_better/cover.jpg[/img]<br />3. Franz Ferdinand - You Could Have It So Much Better<br />Ooh, more rock. This album is every bit as good as the previous one.<br /><br />[img]http://81.176.74.183/covers/g/goldie_lookin_chain/safe_as_fk/cover.jpg[/img]<br />4. Goldie Lookin Chain - Safe As F**k<br />Hilarious Welsh rappers deliver their second album, with another set of classic songs to sing and laugh along to. Probably won't make sense to anyone outside the UK (barely makes sense to people inside the UK [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img] ) but I certainly enjoyed it.<br /><br />[img]http://81.176.74.183/covers/g/gorillaz/2005_-_demon_days/cover.jpg[/img]<br />5. Gorillaz - Demon Days<br />I've started liking Gorillaz again recently. After going off rap for a while, hearing Feel Good Inc. was enough to persuade me to buy it. Of course, the rest of the songs are good too. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] <br /><br />An odd selection, certainly - but I've always liked my music to be varied.[url=http://www.toxicsheep.com]www.toxicsheep.com[/url]<br />[url=http://www.last.fm/user/grafix5000/][img]http://www.toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobblersig.php[/img][/url]"

I can translate the song titles too if you like, but this guy is sick... I bet the music is like that too.[hr]<i>The human brain is not user-friendly...</i>"

This paticular album is a fuse between Classical instrumentation and fast Drum N Bass beats.  It's very good if youre into that sort of thing.[img]http://www.denness.net/rpi/username/mr12000[/img]"
