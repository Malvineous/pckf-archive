Perhaps instead of just moving, we should try to come up with a better system at the same time.  Some sort of 'distributed' forum would be ideal, so that if any one site goes down there are other live sites still working that have up to date data.<br /><br />The only difficult part then would be synchronising all the posts between servers, but just thinking about this there is already a tried and true system for doing this - newsgroups.<br /><br />If we were to set up a few newsgroups at least initially on servers run by us, then any posts to those newsgroups would be synchronised across all servers - if any one server went offline you wouldn't lose any data.  Then all you need is a forum style interface to the newsgroup and as far as anyone can tell it's just a normal web-based forum - except there might be a bunch of different websites where you can access the *same* forum (so that if one website went down you could just use an alternate site.)<br /><br />Any thoughts?

		"content": "Yes, this particular instance the loss was caused by someone hacking ezBoard, but it could've just as easily been a natural disaster, an attack on an upstream provider, catastrophic hardware failure, etc. - my point being that having all your data in only one place is bad, even with backups you can still expect downtime and at least a few lost messages...<br /><br />It's also impossible to spam a newsgroup if you set it up as a moderated group, only allowing each 'authorised server' to post messages on a user's behalf, and if only servers can post messages it'll be difficult to pretend you're someone else.<br /><br />The admins could also have just as much control over the newsgroup as all they'd need to do is delete messages - everything else could be controlled through the web frontends.<br /><br />It's also trivial to back up a newsgroup - anyone can just download a list of newsgroup messages as if they were e-mail messages.  Most e-mail programs already allow you to do this anyway.  Then everyone could make a backup of the entire archive whenever they wanted, which is more than most web boards allow.<br /><br />And it depends on what you mean by 'obsolete' - it wasn't so long ago they were responsible for using up something like 70% of the entire Internet's bandwidth (but that's probably been overtaken by P2P programs now.)  They mightn't have fancy flash animations, but they're still pretty widely used.<br /><br />Anyway, it doesn't have to be newsgroup-based, that was just something that came to mind as it already supports a distributed architecture, which would save us reinventing the wheel.  Anything that would provide a close to realtime synchronisation between multiple servers would do the job nicely."

And then people like me who find it much faster just to use an e-mail program have that option too [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   (plus we'll receive all posts via e-mail whether we read them or not, effectively having a complete backup of the forum on our own PC.)<br /><br />I think we should definitely look into this..."

Well, one is too much, you're right..<br /><br />\"If the PCKF moves, it won't split up. There will still be only one PCKF - it'll just be on Spatang. We were going to move anyway; this just speeded up the waiting process.\"<br />Yes, and it will be fun when xtra gets tired of Keen and gives us the finger and deletes the forums. Then we're dead meat. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-deadkeenvort.gif[/img]  <br />And I was only joking, but I just can't help myself; there's nothing wrong with xtra or spatang.com but then the forums will be owned by xtra. I don't just like the idea that someone just owns these and could get rid of them if wanted. Not to mention the owner could change the forums as he likes and well, do just everything. Starts to feel like a prison. Although, it probably wouldn't be much different from current situation, since chog'all owns these. But for some reason these forums here feel so collective. Well, probably I'm just worried because this forum here at ezBoard has been my second home and it's hard to move. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]   Maybe it's just fear of change.<br />Anyways; I'll naturally go with the flow and see what happens.<br />And to make clear yet one more time: I have nothing against xtra, he's good keenfriend of mine (although he probably doesn't know that [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopekeen.gif[/img]  ).<br />Edit: I'm having a dj vu, as I would've posted something like this before as well..

You know, someone who actually cares about what happens to this forum. Also I think you are looking into this a little too hard with synching multiple servers...<br /><br />All we have to do is implement a backup system right into the boards where anyone, (or specific people who have a password etc) can just back up the forums off of the web. There you go, a backup in separate parts of the world and no need to sync servers.<br /><br />Anyway backups are the least of our worries really.-----------------------<br />\"The Adventures of Commander Keen\" issue #1: coming soon."
