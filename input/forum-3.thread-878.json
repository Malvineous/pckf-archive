		"content": "As some of you may or may not know, I have decided to make a web comic based on Commander Keen. Since I have decided to do this a few months ago, and have yet to turn out a single image, I decided to give an update. First off nothing went right...<br /><br />After making a few pages of Commander Keen drawings, I thought it was turning out relatively good. Ok... so I thought I was ready to make my first page...<br /><br />I started drawing the first page which would be an introduction to Commander Keen. The stuff everybody knows. An 8 year old genius makes a spaceship yadda yadda yadda. Well it wasn't until I scanned in this page that I realized that everything looked like crap. Seriously. All the panels were crooked. It got all smudged (my fault [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-embarrassed.gif[/img] ) And Commander Keen looked like.... I don't know, but not Commander Keen.<br /><br />[img]http://jbrent.no-ip.com/andrew/commanderkeen/bad_billy.bmp[/img]<br />Ehgh![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-shikadi.gif[/img] <br /><br />So I took a big step back and looked at the whole picture. I then realized that my plot line was way too dark (serious) and not really funny. So I totally reworked my entire drawing style for Commander Keen. (Something that you should not do often) and rethought the entire plot. <br />[img]http://jbrent.no-ip.com/andrew/commanderkeen/good_billy.bmp[/img]<br />At this time I decided to take a break and do other stuff... like play Half Life 2 (worth EVERY penny) and finish Doom 3 (not worth anything), remixes and junk like that. So... On wards to my comic beginning.<br /><br />Or so I though.<br /><br />I decided since I'm coloring it in the computer, I won't put the panels in any frames or text on my drawings but rather give all my pictures plenty of room.[img]http://jbrent.no-ip.com/andrew/commanderkeen/page7.png[/img]Then stick them all together in the computer later and color in photoshop. Around this time I thought of using a wacom tablet and draw directly into the computer, but (like the moron that I am) decided to go with pencil and paper. When I got it all scanned in the computer and started coloring it I noticed that it was taking a long time to do. The pictures turned out like I wanted them to look.<br />[img]http://jbrent.no-ip.com/andrew/commanderkeen/colored.png[/img] (only the upper left is finished)<br />So I went and asked my brother (who is a graphic designer major) how he colors in his web comic. Using his wacom tablet he effectively showed me in about 5 minutes what it took me about an hour or so to do with a mouse. Words cannot describe how this feels.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dead.gif[/img]  Needless to say, tomorrow (which is Friday the 1st) I am buying a wacom tablet.<br /><br />Anyway I was hoping to be done by now (1st of April) but it's just not happening. This is where I am right now,for those who care (all one of me [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] ) with the boring stuff omitted.<br /><br />Please ,any comments or questions would be appreciated.-----------------------<br />Save a little money each month and at the end of the year you'll be surprised at how little you have."
