It seems that if I leave the board for more than about 15 minutes, I have to login again. Is this normal? Does EZB have any means of insuring that I login automatically, like on Keen:Modding?<br /><br />(Also, something totally random here, is 'modding' a word? Should it have 2 ds?)[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Awww! Feel the love!"

I suppose that the second 'd' was added because of the allegory. <br /><br />About your second question: Ezboard is indeed a pain in the ass (no pun intended!) if it comes to this. It might also be due to your firewall or cookie settings but probably not.<br /><br />Worry not though, we are going to move really really soon.<br />Right guys? <br />-----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Falling.gif[/img]"
