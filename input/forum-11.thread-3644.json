		"content": "Hey all. During my spare time I created a gaming network in which people can play classic windows and DOS games. There are currently 16 games supported. It is still in developement so each game room has barely any features. Each game room is designed so you can conversate with other players and set up a game by swapping IP's or Phone Numbers. More features will be added in the future, so any suggestions? feedback would be helpful. Thanks and enjoy!<br /><br />To see full list of games supported:<br />[url=http://www.spatang.com/nickssoftware/nsmp/games.txt]www.spatang.com/nickssoft.../games.txt[/url]<br /><br />To goto the NS Gaming Network<br />[url=Http://www.nsmpnetwork.tk]www.nsmpnetwork.tk[/url]<br /><br />If you could link us on your classic DOS site or something that would be great too.<br /><br />Enjoy! (I've already played some Wacky Wheels games there[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img] )"
