I think you guys could guess I don't like porn, and think I, as a Christian, should \"avoid all appearance of evil,\" and if my eye hinders my walk with God to \"pluck it out\" (figuratively, people, figuratively.)  I also think in a perfect world there would be no porn, but, as you all know, its not.<br />  The problem is, I'm not sure that the government, as it is, can really justify taking away people's privacy.  People deserve their privacy, and if they cross the line and invade their privacy once, they will feel more at liberty to invade it in anything and everything they do, and that's something that would be pretty bad (in the Bible, it says one of the signs of the end times would be basically something like people having to register for food, by having 666, the devil's number, written on their hand or forehead.

Soon we were caught by some nasty-lookin' seniors, but once we told them what we were doing, they joined our cause and successfully removed a lot of the magazines from the locker. By now, a large crowd of teenage boys had gathered (this was an all-boys highschool!) and the pilfered magazines were being butchered among the ravenous masses, most of whom had probably never encountered a real live porno mag before and were just as much into the novelty or rarity of it as the sexual aspects.<br /><br />After that day, pages of porno mag had distributed themselves all around the school, ending up in lockers, schoolbags, classrooms... And when the juvenile delinquent found out that my friend had started it all, he was not impressed. He had gone to a lot of hard work to steal those magazines from the trash at the back of a corner dairy. <br /><br />So, er, back on topic, ummm, porn was fun until the internet came along and ruined it by making it easily accessible and mundane.----------<br />www.StrifeStrips.com!

Of course there are exceptions to this, as with anything else.<br /><br />Anyway that is just my opinion on the age thing. Can you stop a determined 14 year old from looking at porn? No. I mean look at spywear. Just turn on someone's computer and before you can do anything an ad pops up with a girl fingering herself.
