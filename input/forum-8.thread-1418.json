I remember hearing a news report about a bombing and people dying on the subway system. Then I yelled at my sister and made her turn off the TV and promptly fell back asleep. Then, I had some weird dream about dragons and pirate ships or something I don't remember but I thought the news report was a dream in my head. But now I know it's not.<br /><br />Like I said I am sooo confused right now. I need a sanity power drink.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]God dammit when will the violence ever end.[hr][/quote]<br />Um... never. Take a look at what happened to Israel. That is what is going to keep happening. It will keep going no matter what happens or what any politician says. It's sad but true.
