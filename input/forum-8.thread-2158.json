The last ~10 seconds is *excellent*; however, before that, there are points where you need to work on your transitions.  Some of the samples you're using, also, sound a bit outdated - however it has *a lot* of potential - nuture it, and it will be fantastic.------------------<br />[url=http://www.szevvy.net]www.szevvy.net[/url], for all your Wombat needs.
