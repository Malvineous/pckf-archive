Yes, there's glowy spike balls of death on either side... but save your game, and give it a shot--you'll have to be further to the right than you think, but it'll work eventually.  After you fall off the bottom of the screen, press \"up\" as if you were going to enter a door--poof!  You're up where the points are.<br /><br />Wouldn't be worth it without the Save-and-Reload option.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>  Waaaaay too risky."
