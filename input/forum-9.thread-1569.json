You can find him in the IRC channel, usually.<br /><br />Ilsoap's not around as much as he used to be, but he's always been a good judge of what's going on, IMKO.<br /><br />KeenRush has a bit of power in a few of the boards here, and he's proably THE most active guy in the Keen community.  If anything, we should increase his power to all boards here...<br /><br />I'm an admin (a deputy admin, actually) over at Keen:Modding, and while I like it, I feel that I don't quite use the power wisely yet.  I've made mistakes, I've stepped on toes, and I worry that I'm a rules-lawyer sometimes.  I'd rather not be a moderator on these boards.<br /><br />Najawa and Harvey are both newbies, who have been here less than 6 months.  The board's rule is that you can't get a custom title here untill you've got at least 314 posts, and have been around for 6 months... It'd be foolish to make someone a moderator who isn't even elligible for a custom title yet.<br /><br />Malvineous I don't know enough about to vote either way.
