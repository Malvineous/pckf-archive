I think it was called \"CKU\" or something similar. Does anyone know where this is?<br /><br />2. Music and Sounds. Last I knew, there wasn't an \"easy\" way to get the audio (music and sound effects) from the official games. Has anyone figured this out?<br />Or does anyone have the audio extracted?"

		"content": "The extracted music has been floating around this forum for a while now, and some people have gone to the trouble of converting it from its original IMF format into MIDI.  I can post a link for you if you're interested (and nobody else beats me to it.)<br /><br />As to the sounds I'm not entirely sure.  Andrew Durdin came up with some code that would convert the sound effects into digital audio, which many years ago I merged into my \"FileView\" shell extension, which meant that once you [url=http://www.shikadi.net/old/fileview/]installed FileView[/url], you could double-click on the audio files in Windows Explorer and it would open up as if it was a folder full of IMF and .WAV files, and to extract the sounds you could just drag the .wav files out into another folder.  Unfortunately the version at the other end of that link only lists Keen 1-3 as a formats, so I've got no idea whether it supports Keen4-6 or not.  I remember coding it, so I'm not sure why it hasn't made it into that file...but maybe it has and I just didn't update the docs [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]"
