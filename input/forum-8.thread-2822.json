Long story short, not very well.<br /><br />We tried to film it, but the batteries to the camera were flat so we only got about an hour of footage that barely caught me tipsy (but got some shots of me consuming an unpleasant combination of sugar, raspberry something, Jim Beam and Vodka, a spoonful at a time...). <br /><br />In the end, I shouted at the ceiling to take away my ability to taste, and sculled about 200ml of Jim Beam. Worked well... I couldn't taste it, and after that I was wasted (and particularly distressed at my lack of hand-eye coordination, I'm told).<br /><br />I recovered well from that one, though. Woke up at 9am the next morning feeling better than ever. Much better than the last time back in 2003 where I woke up to find a pile of vomit next to my head.
