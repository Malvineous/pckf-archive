I remember being very proud of myself and even more disappointed when I was unable to upload it to my ISP's server. I will always look back at that memory and see how far I've come, which will inspire me to reach ever greater heights. In fact, I think that's inspirational enough to stick in my signature.<br /><br />Some things to do to improve your website:<br /> * Don't use Times New Roman. Learn to use CSS instead. (I'll explain CSS below - it's quite simple, really)<br /> * Check all spellings. Incorrect spelling and grammar looks appalling and can spoil even the best of websites. (Not natively speaking English is the only good excuse for bad spelling)<br /> * Animated GIFs are bad. Never use them unless you cannot avoid it. (Which is to say, almost never)<br /> * Visitor counters are lame - get rid of it. The only reason for having a visitor counter is to boast how many visitors you have. (And how did yours get to 10,000? [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-offended.gif[/img]  )<br /> * Red and green do not go well together. These are the best text/background combinations to use:<br /> ** Black on white (boring)<br /> ** White/green/blue/red on black<br /> ** Black on light grey/blue/red<br /> ** White on dark grey/blue/red<br /> Never use any text colours other than black and white, unless you're on a black background or are using them for emphasis (eg titles). <i>Never</i> use yellow or any dark, non-black colours as text.<br /><br />And CSS? Just put the following at the top of your page:[pre] &lt;style&gt; body { font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvectia, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; }&lt;/style&gt;[/pre]<br />This will set the font to Verdana, or one of the other fonts in the list if Verdana is not available. It will set the font size to 11 pixels high.<font color=\"BLACK\"><br />My [url=http://kevan.org/brain.cgi?grafix5000]MindBending Power[/url] is 5.43 points.<br />Possibly the [url=http://legion.gibbering.net/misterx/troutwar.php?s=grafix5000]funniest thing[/url] on the interweb.<br />Go to [url=http://www.toxicsheep.com]www.toxicsheep.com[/url] to see my site!<br /></font><br />[img]http://www.toxicsheep.com/sigs/scrobblersig.php[/img]"

I can only imagine what it'd have been like if the online Keen scene existed back when I was 9... makes me all nostalgic just thinking about it...<br /><br />As for the site, I'd suggest aligning the text to centre, changing the colour (experiment to see which works), and using perhaps a bold Tahoma or Verdana... and the Keen6 clifface image really isn't suited to a background image, IMKO--perhaps if you used a tiled level background (for example, the purple living wall first seen in Guard Post One... though it might take some messing around to get a text colour that works) it might work better...<br /><br />Good work, though. The mere fact you have something on the web at such an age is absolutely awesome. Keep it updated, experiment, and read up on the subject to improve your webdev skills, and eventually you'll have something jaw-dropping.
