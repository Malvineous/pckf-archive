[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-no.gif[/img] <br /><br />But seriously...getting past the dopefish is fairly challenging, but it's quite possible once you know how.  And often after a few tries.<br /><br />First of all, you can swim faster by pressing Ctrl (I think [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-rolleyes.gif[/img] ) repeatedly while moving, which will be really helpful in getting past the dopefish.  Also, if one is blocking a narrow passage and you need to get by, note that it slowly swims back and forth at the entrance.  If you quickly slip by while it's facing away from the passage, it won't turn and nab you and you can zip away.  In addition, it helps to keep an entourage of schoolfish behind you.  If they trail you far enough behind and you can manoeuver [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-british.gif[/img]  yourself well, the dopefish will eat one of them.  You can run past while it pauses to burp.<br /><br />Beyond that, just be fast and keep your distance as much as you can.[img]http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k284/KeegTech/WarholDopefishPNG2.png[/img]"
