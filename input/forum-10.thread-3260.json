I never watch movies, but since I was with some friends, they didn't give me much of a choice.<br /><br />I thought Face/Off was really boring. The movie was incredibly predictable, and was basically a series of action sequences. [Yawn]<br /><br />I thought Ned Kelly was really boring, I couldn't really care for it.<br /><br />Goodfellas was interesting as it was the first R rated movie I ever watched (which is under Australian standards, which is the highest possible rating for a film), and I actually quite enjoyed it although the last 20 minutes of it was REALLY slow.<br /><br />However the last DVD I bought was The O.C.

I almost freaked out and thought about it for hours before I could concentrate even slightly to something other stuff. I felt very depressed and void because it actually made me think that my mind really was trapped in some merciless machine world (ironically that was true in a way since I used computer a lot).<br /><br />And when I walked out from the cinema after seeing Matrix: Reloaded I had same kind of philosophical uneasiness in my mind. I felt again a bit unreal. This time it didn't last very long, though.<br /><br />It's strange how they don't really care at all if a movie is mentally disturbing when they give it age-ratings. If it has some violence or \"bad language\" they easily make it suitable only for more mature audience but if the movie can make one doubt the very existence or makes one worry about something so much that one almost loses one's mind they don't really consider that being worse than some violence and words.
