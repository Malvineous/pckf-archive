Money saver! Pass Pass!!!<br /><br />*Mid febuary in the upper huse after bill passes 67 votes to nil...*<br /><br />G.W.Bush: Me is confused? What this mean?<br /><br />Politician: Some math thing, we save money!<br /><br />Rest of politicians: Pass! Pass!!<br /><br />*suddenly*<br /><br />University Lecturer: This is teh stoopid!<br /><br />Politicians: OMG! He is right! But we can't cancel it or we'll look stupid!<br /><br />Lawyer: The we should postpone it <i>sine die!</i><br /><br />[Sorry Xtra]<br /><br />So if anyone here is from Indiana, why not visit your local representative and push to have bill 246 put through the house of representitives; its still on the statute books!A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

If we were using a radix of Pi rather than one of those stupid integers like 2, 10 or 16, it could easily be written as 10. Problem solved.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />The development of the hardware, and the greater ability to express every idea that flies into a programmers head, mean that game creators have made the new games congested with every technique in their power. The basic games behind all this are so blurred that people cant catch up. We should go back to basics  like Pac-Man  and play in an easier, more relaxed way. -Toru Iwatani<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
