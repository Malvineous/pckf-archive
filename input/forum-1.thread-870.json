There seems no other way around that door - I have tried to jump up a little bit to the left of that door - without avail.<br />I have been patient: I have searched all the places I could get to in this level, found all the hidden points, but not the blue keygem. <br />Probably I am not ingenius enough for this part of the level. Can anyone help me out?"
