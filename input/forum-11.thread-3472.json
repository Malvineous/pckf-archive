I always find it somewhat discouraging when a fangame recycles old enemies.<br /><br />Isis II was always a mixed success with me--I liked the fact that there was an increased palette, but I really didn't like the multiple weapons thing.  There were original monsters which were pretty well animated, but there was a health meter.  There were interesting level design concepts, but the gameplay wasn't quite Keenish.  It was still a monumental effort, and I'm thankful for the previews we have/had."
