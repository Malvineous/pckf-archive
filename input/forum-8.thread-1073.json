I've found two things so far that seem to resemble keen, although not intentional, probably.<br /><br /> [img]http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k296/Medevila/supertuxmushroom.jpg[/img]<br />This one, actually turns whichever way you are turned, and bounces! Reminds me a lot of the mushroom.<br /><br />Also, there is a dopefish (looks exactly like it) chasing a little orange fish. They are both both frozen in ice, though. I hope to get a picture of that in soon. Version 3 doesn't have that tile. I need to download an earlier for a bit."
