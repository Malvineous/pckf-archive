Well you might of saw these already but I know no one here checks my DA account so...<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Self-portrait.jpg[/img]<br />It's made of construction paper that we cut out and layered on top of the piece underneath. We based it off of a photograph our teacher took and then increased the contrast on. We were only allowed 4 colors.<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Worst-pun.jpg[/img]<br />It's the um... Worst pun ever...<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Drac-Kreuz-200px.png[/img]<br />My dragon (Red) character and my most excellent friend's dragon (Pink / peach) character, sitting back to back. I am very fond of this one.<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Droom-scene-BW.png[/img]<br />A black and white piece I was pretty fond of. I think it's the best B&amp;W thing I ever did so far. Sure there are a lot of mistakes but I just like the way it looks.<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Draconis---Laurael-commere.png[/img]<br />Ok OKAY! Not exactly \"Non-Keen-Related\" but it's cute.<br />Lookitim! ^_^<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Aya.jpg[/img]<br />You might know this character if you like Online Comics.<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Wicked.jpg[/img]<br />Heh... WICKED!<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Lonely.png[/img]<br />Another try at black and white. (This time with grey!) Looks ok... but not as good as the other one.<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/way-high-up.jpg[/img]<br />Way high up.<br />Not one of the BEST pieces I ever did but this is by far my FAVORITE piece I ever did. It's my dragon character, (Once again red.) and my good friend's dragon character (The pink bubble dragon.) having some trouble with helium.<br /><br />Well that's just a taste of Gal's Gallery. Hope it wasn't too painful to look at.<br /><br />(And sorry about the resizing of the images... ever since I put in my new video card Photoshop doesn't anti-alias the images good anymore. I don't know why.)-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/New-blegd-smeeg-banner-60.png[/img][/url]"
