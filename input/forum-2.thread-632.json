		"content": "Actually, the subject is more interesting than this post. I'm working on a platform engine, and using Keen graphics to test it. By the time I'm done, I'll have a game which should be at least mildly amusing. Right now I've just got a yorp (I drew a high-res version of the original sprite) who can be made to walk around. My collision detection seems to be perfect (I surprised myself there), so I suppose I'll work up some sort of level format next. I've really got nothing remarkable, except that tiles can be placed anywhere; not just in an evenly spaced grid.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/YorpEye.png[/img]"
