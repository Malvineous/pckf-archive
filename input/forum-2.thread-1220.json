For most of Xtraverse's mods, it's Norp#.bat, for me it's XkyKeen#.bat, and so on.  Just running Keen1.exe will cause problems!!<br /><br />If you want to make your own mods, there's really very little programming involved, unless you WANT to do that hard stuff!  <br />For the most part, you run ModKeen, which spits out a whole bunch of BMP files for you... you edit them, change the graphics, and then use ModKeen to put it back into the game files.  After that, just create new levels, change some text, make your own BAT file and then run the darn thing--instant mod!  :-)<br /><br />Spatang.com is a great site for info--not only can you download other peoples' mods and open them up to see how they're put together, but you can read tutorials on how to do your own stuff!<br /><br />Welcome to the community, too.  :-)[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"
