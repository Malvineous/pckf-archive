Enough to cover at least 3/4 of the screen graphically - but the most outer areas of the explosion sphere are weak enough for keen or the others to survive it.<br /><br /><b>Let's say</b> 3/4 of the screen = 600 pixels. Than the explosion has a radius of 300 pixels (diameter 600). Keen is killed when he is within 500 pixels of the epicenter.<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dexter.gif[/img]  I guess you might want to read that again or draw it down. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img]  I think the 2nd paragraph is more like some data for you.<br /><br />One thing - don't overwhelm the level with ammunation of this kind unless the players will tend to rely on this. Each dropsite (under dropsite I mean the collectible gun item) should perhaps only give you 1 bullet. And depending on map size, I don't advise more than 3 dropsites. Respawn time of the dropsite (re-appearance (waits to be collected again)) should be rather huge. The goal is to keep the player from collecting more and more of this deadly item in a short time.<br /><br />And depending on the abilities of Game Maker, some transparency effect of the explosion would be cool, but this is not so important. \"From one medium size green bullet to a chain-reaction like light-green explosion covering half the map[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mortlol.gif[/img] \"------------------------------------------------------<br />Keep in mind, I'm not an artist.<br /><br />\"Take evasive action!\""

I haven't even attempted that yet, and I don't think I'm gonna have it in my game because I'm not going to have a strong platform element in it (basically, you fly around in your ship to go to places, and at those places you walk around like in K4-6, minus advanced moves, unless it's an enemy place like Koreth III Base for example.)<br />Anyway, what might really help is someone who knows whatever language Keen4-6 was programmed in( is it C?), and could get the source code and explain the way that that particular action is written.<br />And if I may humbly make a sugestion about CKGI...can you change Mortimer's sprites to make him in all black? [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mort.gif[/img]  (I know what my name says, and I didnt get it just to put momentum behind this request - I just couldnt think of a better name at the time). It just seems to me that Mortimer should be in all black because he's the grand villian and all and it just seems very fitting.<br />It's up to you - shouldnt be that difficult since the objects will run just the same as long as the sprite is the same size and shape.The Universe is Toast..."

None of the actions in Keen is really unique (besides the pogo), so you can probably find someone to tell you how to accomplish them. You don't need the Keen source for that."
