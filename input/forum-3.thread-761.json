I read on CC314 news that Flaose had wiped out his email, and didn't quite know where to put it.<br /><br />In either case, I finally got into the mood and finished part 1 of the story.  Feedback and spotted errors for when I finally submit it appreciated.<br /><br />(Parts 1 and 2 now up.  Anyone up for hosting 2?

I'm only showing it now that I know I'll finish it.  I'm on a writing spree, I'm nearly done with part 2, and even the parts seem to be getting shorter as I grow older and learn terseness.
