For some reason it's always had the codename 'OrbKeen'. It's evolved a lot since its conception, and shall mutate even further when I start working on it again.<br /><br />The project page can be viewed at the following URL:<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/keen/spleen/projects/monky.html]jimsoft.spatang.com/keen/...monky.html[/url]<br /><br />The beta, which was released late 2004, can be downloaded here:<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/keen/spleen/archive/orbkbeta.zip]jimsoft.spatang.com/keen/...bkbeta.zip[/url]<br /><br />I'd be very interested to hear any comments, questions or suggestions y'all may have, now that there's a place for such things."

I can't remember any of the gameplay, but next time I get some spare time, I'll have another play of it and be able to give you some better comments.<br /><br />It's good to hear that you're going to finish it."

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]  Well, this is definitely worth waiting. The beta is just awesome, I've played it through a few times and should do that again.. This'll be great once done..
