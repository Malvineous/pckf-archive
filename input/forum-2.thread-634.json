The slime balls fly the way a person throws a baseball - they launch up, but fall back to the ground.<br /><br />I have 10 very unique (and I think you'll find pretty cool) creatures designed so far including the above.<br />9 have at least one frame sketches drawn.<br />7 have their behavior designed.<br />3 have a good amount of graphics ready.<br /><br />Edit: I keep an eye on my ezInbox, so feel free to use that too!"
