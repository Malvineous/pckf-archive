		"content": "You'll have to be more specific when you say \"Hard,\" I think.<br /><br />To me, given the ability to save mid-level, Keens 4, 5, and 6 are extremely \"easy\" relative to Keens 1, 2, and 3.  Any part of a level that seems challenging can be essentially save-stated and attempted time and time again until passed, without the aggravation of doing the entire level over upon failure.<br /><br />At the same time, the enemies in Keens 4, 5, and 6 aren't nearly as threatening or quick-moving as the enemies in the first trilogy.  The most dangerous enemy I can think of in each episode (4's Skypest, 5's Shelley, and 6's Bip) are only threatening because they catch you off guard by attacking by surprise--there is no way any enemy in 4, 5, or 6 can be threatening all by themselves in the middle of a hallway.  Compare that to Keen1's Vorticons, Keen2's Elites, and Keen3's Vortininjas... Those things can tear through a level, jumping over obstacles, shooting, moving faster than you, etc.  They pose much more threat than a Poison Slug, Sparky, or Bloog can.<br /><br />Also, you didn't specify how much of the game we're talking about.  I might feel that The Bloogdome has a part in it on Hard mode that isn't fair and should be edited to be easier--but that's just one part of what I feel is the easiest episode of Keen.  Compare that to the entirety of Keen3, and it looks like a snoozefest.  <br /><br />To me, the hardest Keen to complete, start to finish, without cheats, is Keen3.  The levels are so brutal, unbalanced, and apparently untested, it's a relief to discover we only have to pass a level or two to see the ending.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"

If you coudln't do that in 4-6, some levels would be really irritating)  but I don't think the mangling machine is really too bad.  All you need is to get your timing down, and have enough bullets.<br />  I think the hardest levels in Keen3 are the three castle levels that are grouped together.  I honestly don't think I ever even bothered to beat those levels.<br />  Actually I found Keen2 the most irritatingly hard.  I hated the Washington DC one.<br />  I don't know about Keen 4-6's AI not being as hard though.  THere are a ton of foes in those (4 especially) that you can't even beat, and the keen4 enemies that you can beat you can only beat in certain situations (pests, the wormmouth things that jump out at you, the rock/mushrooms that jump at you)<br />  I think the eagle and fireball guy to be two of the hardest foes if you're in a corner (the fire level in keen4 on hard is very difficult)."
