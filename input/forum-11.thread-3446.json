And I am waiting for [url=http://www.introversion.co.uk/defcon/]Defcon[/url], checking the website ever 5 minutes for more news."

You need a good graphics card (to be honest my current graphics card won't play anything except Commander Keen and BioMenace), with 3d Acceleration/Hardware Support.  It's worth playing, and there's that little kick of optimism you get when you see your little darwinians fighting back against the Viruses.<br /><br />Or you can just form squads and fire huge lasers and rockets at them, but that's not as fun as seeing little green men with tiny lasers shooting long Snake-like red things."
