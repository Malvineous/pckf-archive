Like in a pond, although the surface would be smooth, below it there would be constant movement; canstant random variation, and because of that some would end badly, others well off.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

I'm sure you are all familiar with the Communist system of government, and if the government start messing around with the American peole's money that's what it will become.<br />  I really like LordofGlobox's post last post.  America's government was not intended to be a charity or to specialize in handouts.  Did Bill Gates earn his money? If he did, then the government can't just take it.  Did Donald Trump earn his money?  Then the government can't take it!  This is one reason why I think property taxes is so bad.  The government has no right to tax YOUR property.  I think what we all forget is that WE are the United State of America, not the government.  Actually, the government was designed for three purposes, and three only as shown in the constitution.<br />1: Preserve (as in preserving the system of government,etc.<br />2:Protect (from people like terrorists,etc.)<br />3:Promote the general welfare (not meaning take thir property, give big handouts, and dictate our lives)<br /> <br />Well, that's how it is written, and too much has changed (that's how I see it anyhow!!)"
