[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Anyway, I'm planning on continuing with this mod.<br />I pretty much stopped right after posting this original post, so there's still a bunch of things to be done.Retodon8<br />You live, you die, you are remembered, you are forgotten."
