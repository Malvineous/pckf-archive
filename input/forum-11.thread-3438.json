It links to a level editor, but there's no source available for it. Might make it a bit easier to work out the format at least."

But I don't know if Karl will let me give it to you.<br /><br />I can tell you that the first byte of a level file indicates which background is shown in the game and the second byte which music is played. The rest of the file is probably just like the level format of Duke Nukem II.Groeten van Frenkel<br />Visit [url=http://www.sfprod.cjb.net]The Official S&amp;F Prod. Homepage[/url]"
