Incredible. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img]  Where else could you find comics about regular expressions, LISP, GOTO, factoring, Hamiltonian circuits/paths, the traveling salesman problem, the knapsack problem, the command prompt, cryptography, string theory, Donald Knuth, the Riemann-Zeta function, M.C. Escher, iambic pentameter, the Donner Party, the Poisson distribution, and of course Bill Nye? Seriously, this comic is amazing."

Got number 16 at the meat deli, at which point I decided to call it a programmer's dozen and ordered that many sausages for my BBQ, and then I got shifted from register 15 to 16 when checking out. I found that amusing.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Malvineous</b> Ha, how'd you get the chessboard onto the ride???<br />[hr]Easier than you'd think. They're not very strict on that coaster, letting you take bags on there as long as they're kept at your feet. Not that there was any foot room--the bag is actually sitting between the two seats.<br /><br />Strangely enough, the ride broke down just a few minutes after we got out.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mort.gif[/img] <br /><br />The plan was to get a photo on the Wild West ride, but the water was problematic with the Blu-Tack (I didn't feel like wasting a chessboard by actually using super glue, so now I have seven tubes of it... guess I'll start fixing a lot of broken stuff)."
