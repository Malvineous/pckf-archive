This is revenge because XkyKeen1 was so good mod, now I'll try to ruin everyone's memory of that mod by bringing in annoying level pack for it. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mortlol.gif[/img]  No, seriously, this is a tribute to a neat mod. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  As well, this is a surprise dedicated to Xky. I haven't told him about this yet (and therefore haven't asked permission [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-embarrassed.gif[/img] ).<br /><br />Now some screens. These screens could be better, there are hundreds of places that look better than those pictured below.<br /><br />[img]http://www.keengrid.net/keenrush/tuned1.gif[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.keengrid.net/keenrush/tuned2.gif[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.keengrid.net/keenrush/tuned3.gif[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.keengrid.net/keenrush/tuned4.gif[/img]<br /><br />The first one to complete all the levels can get year's supply of Gaaarg Cola!

Those are pretty much impossible for me.  <br /><br />This is a really awesome surprise, though--thanks, KeenRush!  :-D  I'd forgotten some of the tiles I drew but never used in XkyKeen1... and now I see them!<br /><br />The only real comment I have is that you didn't use my gears turning in opposite directions--there'll be a line of gears next to each other, all turning in the same way.  I made 2 different gears, so that they could alternate clockwise and counterclockwise.  :-)  Oh well.  This is still cool!"

That level which begins with a drop right into it was the fastest I've ever gotten game over in a Keen game.  :-)  <br /><br />I really enjoyed your levels, though.  You did an excellent job of varying the traps and tricks the player would have to use.  I think it'd still be a satisfying level pack with half the traps in it.  It was really nice of you to make a level pack for XkyKeen1.  :-D"
