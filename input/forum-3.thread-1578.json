He's one of the many lurkers on this forum. [I know you can read this, join up for chrissakes!]<br /><br />I have been begging him to Keen in his cartoons, and he did! And this weeks episode appeared in Krash, a kids and teens magazine, to be read by thousands. After months of nagging he has placed 8 Keen references into his latest comic. I have only found 2 so far.<br /><br />So I scanned the whole lot and am hosting them for your beady eyes to run over. See if you can find all 8 references, you'll win a prize!*<br /><br />1: [img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/pchic.jpg[/img]<br /><br />2: [img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/pchic001.jpg[/img]<br /><br />3: [img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/pchic002.jpg[/img]<br /><br />4: [img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/pchic003.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br />[*Prize may not actually exist]<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Amusing nonetheless.<br /><br />Lessee... firstly, that \"captain\" bit is probably a tad too subtle to be a reference... of course, the 'blooog' bit... does she always have that teddy? ... the SGA on the fridge ... the pole... maybe the green stuff in the fridge is an allusion to Vitalin ... there could be something in those bits of 'scary message' text along the edges of the frames in the fridge episode, but it's difficult to read theim in their entirety at this resolution.<br /><br />So I've found about 3-5.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
