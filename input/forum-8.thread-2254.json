		"content": "Werl, the thing is this: Strips like Peanuts ain't great because every strip is awesome, or even because one strip is awesome either. They're great because they've been around for ages and ages, and have formed a culture around them over time.<br />Peanuts comes from a decade where Peanuts might have been one of three comic strips available to the public on a daily basis. So naturally, its charm grew on people and people grew with it.<br />But these days, with The Innernets, it's a different story. If your comic strip is as good as Peanuts, then I'm sorry but nobody is going to read it. Go and find one Peanuts strip that was really good. Go on, I dare you. You won't find it. The greatness of Peanuts is not to be found in one strip. Its greatness is infinitesimal, but when you sum up all those comics (and add the constant of integration), only then will you find greatness.<br />The only way that new comics can compete with the zillions of other internet comics these days is to be a helluva lot better than Peanuts, every time. Because if your comic strip fails to hit the mark, it might still be published on the internet tomorrow and the next day and the next, but nobody is going to read it. They're going to read somebody else's strip which is pretty much indentical to yours (three panels, sarcastic stereotypes of this \"modern\" age of political cynicism and jokes about computer software OH HOW THEY NEVER GET OLD) but just happened to be funnier in that one strip on that particular day.<br />With internet comics, you don't quite get the luxury of \"hogging the media\" that Peanuts got back in the days when newspaper comic strips ruled all of comics literature.<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-pig.gif[/img]   The End----------<br />www.StrifeStrips.com!

		"content": "Actually, when peanuts was first brought out, comics were allowed a far greater share of the comic page, the first few decades of peanuts were always in color and featured half page 9-10 panel comics. Over the years newspapaer editors have cut the comic's space to save costs, also moving away from color, to the point that many newspapers now have only a small comic section.<br /><br />Peanuts itself has sidelined many of its characters over the years and simplified its format to comply with the simpler 'gag strips' produced nowdays. Many cartoonists, most vocally Bill Watterson [Calvin and Hobbes] have claimed that this has caused a drastic loss of quality in the comics industry.<br /><br />Webcomics are now quite a mature fad. Free from the constraints of newspapers they can be as graphic, controversial, colorful or unusual as they want. They do not have to have popular followings, and, like in the 1940's where each newspaper in a city [and a city could have dozens] would have their own strip, cult strips can emerge with their own small communities [Such as GCW or Strife Strips] Comics no longer need instatnt popularity or commercial appeal, this explains the great popularity of webcomics, some of which can be very high quality [But you don't need to be anywhere near quality to survive, viz qwanrtz.com]<br /><br />Comics proper, such as marvel are increasingly more commercialy orientated but are to an extent free from the contraints of newspapers, you can see many colorful and interesting techniques at play that have been tried and tested over the years. While some say that such comics have stagneated, [perhaps to an extent this is true, new ideas are untested and risky, so not often tried] and pander to popular prejudice [9 out of 10 superheroes are white males] they are still an enjoyable and interesting read.<br /><br /><br />Yes, I did a project on comics in english class, can you tell?<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Cute bunny!"
