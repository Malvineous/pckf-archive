Check videos:<br />[url=http://files.filefront.com/Dave2HQL1002165avi/;4640220;;/fileinfo.html]files.filefront.com/Dave2...einfo.html[/url] // Level 1,<br />[url=http://files.filefront.com/Dave2HQL2002665avi/;4640239;;/fileinfo.html]files.filefront.com/Dave2...einfo.html[/url] // Level 2<br />Level 3, though, was a lot harder, I managed to blast to the bottom of the level by shooting only 4 bullets on my way. Then it got harder and I had to shoot almost everyone on sight. I found out how to jump quickly up the stairs without getting mashed by a ghoul but I still got whacked at the top. Levels 4 and further were rather hard and I didn't try them yet.<br />Great game."
