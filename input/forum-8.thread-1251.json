Both adult/grownup dolphin genders (at least Bottlenose Dolphins) have bigger genitals than humans do, which basically means that once they find dolphins it would be physically easy.. In a way. There can be problems with the fact that those animals live in water, are a lot stronger and bigger than humans. The male dolphin genitalia may cause severe damage/pain, kinda like in this case (a news article):<br />[url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1739698,00.html]www.news24.com/News24/Wor...98,00.html[/url]<br />It's about some man who was penetrated by a stallion, and \"Basically, his colon was ruptured, along with his lower organs in that region, and he bled out\".
