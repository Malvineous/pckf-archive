This is not the Commander Keen comic I have been working on. I just needed a break.<br /><br />If anyone can come up with a better name for the garg than \"Blegd\" please tell me. (By the way. Blegd is is my avatar. I find him cuter than Smeeg) <br /><br />And I put an extra line at the end and posted it somewhere, if you have seen my other art you probably know where to find it.<br /><br />*EDIT*<br /><br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Number1Introductionssuckcolorednoex.png[/img]-----------------------<br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/shikadimastercopy.gif[/img]"

It IS Wednesday, almost THURSDAY! Shows you how busy I have been.) and I finished the comic for Monday. I am sorry it is late but I tried some new things that made it take longer (Yet look better and cleaner.) and then life threw some of it's things into the mix taking up yet more time. I know no one cares about excuses so I will get to the point.<br /><br />I am going to put out Monday's comic on Friday and hopefully it will give me more time to do Friday's comic which will be released on Monday...<br /><br />Hopefully.<br /><br />This is the holiday season... This means work is MAD busy. I am getting twice the amount of hours I would usually get and I now work to 11 PM instead of 9:30 PM. The last thing I want to do when I come home is draw. Between school and work I don't have that much time to do anything. So bare with me through the holidays and hopefully it will become more regular after Christmas.<br /><br />Oh... how I hate the holiday.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Blegdandsmeegdbanner60copy.gif[/img][/url]"
