He doesn't amuse me at all.<br /><br />I don't know much work of 'classic' comedians (for lack of a better description), so I really couldn't say any of them as my favourites.--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"

Russell Peters, on the other hand, did a lot of funny stuff involving Indian, African, and Chinese people which I found hilarious."
