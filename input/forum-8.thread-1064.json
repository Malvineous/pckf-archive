I'll be sure to spam it to some folks to enhance your fame.<br /><br />Dnde Esta Jeff? is great. It takes the best clips and crops them to perfection. For example, the rubbish bin one loses its impact when you drop out of character and walk toward the camera in the original.<br /><br />Much applause to thee."
