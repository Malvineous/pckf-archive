The PSP's frustrating loading times, terrible UMD range, and dull games bored me to tears. (I only briefly sampled it at an electronic outlet)<br /><br />Although the DS can definately use some more \"mature\" games though. Most games are aimed at a much younger audience, or are based on movies.-- Censorship is F**ked! --"
