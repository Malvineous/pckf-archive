As you know, you can get both up and down there. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />LL - yeah, talk about it.. First trying to get down.. Then walking to right and trying to jump there to get the blue gem. Then trying to get out of there again, down..<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"
