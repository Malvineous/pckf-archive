After running around in circles all over the Internet in search of more and more information, and trying out several other programs (such as NeOS-10 and Artisoft LANTastic), I came across a couple of references to MS Client 3, which told me to type:<br /><br />net use &lt;map drive&gt; \\\\&lt;target computer&gt;\\&lt;network path&gt;<br /><br />So, I went along and installed it and voila! Instant access to Win98 and XP (but not Me... it's a whore... but that's a completely different episode altogether [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-furious.gif[/img] ).<br /><br />Then I went and loaded up Duke3d on the Win98 computer and started a network game for two players. I did the same on the DOS machine, but it crashed after initialising IPX and starting the search loop. However, when I looked back at the Win98 machine, it had come up with a message informing me a second player had indeed successfully joined.<br /><br />Woo!<br /><br />I'm still unable to access the DOS computer from Win98/XP, and I'm still running blind, but I'm getting there.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-yorp.gif[/img] <br /><br />Useful stuff:<br />[url=http://fhctech.org/fhc/networking/dosclient.htm]DOS Client Configuration[/url]<br />[url=http://computing.net/dos/wwwboard/forum/9321.html]Computing.Net - DOS 6.22 networking with windows[/url]<br /><br />&gt;Commander SpleenCave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />\"[T]here's far too little sharing in this world and it's a sad place because of it.

In order to access DOSHIPPY from other machines, one needs to run 'net share &lt;sharename (ie. C-DRIVE)&gt; = &lt;path (ie.

Basically, all I need to do now is run LSL.COM (I'm running the 2.16 version from that site), then the NetWare ODI DOS driver (in my case, EP320R.COM) and finally IPXODI.COM. Then everything's set up to run games via IPX! And it works alongside MS Client 3 with TCP/IP filesharing.<br /><br />Yeehaw!! Duke3d and Death Rally work beautifully! Woooo!<br /><br />Next phase: finding monitors that aren't on the verge of death, so I can actually see what I'm doing in Duke3d.<br /><br />&gt;Commander SpleenCave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />\"[T]here's far too little sharing in this world and it's a sad place because of it.
