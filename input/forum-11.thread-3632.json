Szevvy, I recall you mentioning somewhere you had some issues with the decompression code (dropping bytes at the end I think.)  Which files did you have trouble with?  I haven't encountered any problems so far, but I've only tried it with a few files.<br /><br />I also did up a 4-bit VOC decoder so I can listen to some of the sounds - here's one that's been decompressed and decoded.  I've resampled it to 11025Hz and converted to .wav so you can listen to it in your favourite proggy [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br />[url=http://members.optushome.com.au/malvineous/digi_dog-11k.wav]digi_dog-11k.wav[/url]"

Of course I'm running it under Linux through Wine, so it's quite possibly a Wine issue instead.<br /><br />Thanks for the offer of the Monster Bash info - once I've got my editor to a more usable state, I'll probably take you up on that [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"
