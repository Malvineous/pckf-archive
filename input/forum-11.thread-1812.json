		"content": "Greetings.<br /><br />I came to this forum to browse a bit, but I noticed that some topics regard adlib music, and finding it in its original form. I started to custom rip and otherwise prepare music from many PC games that use the Ad Lib sound card. You can listen to the music the way it was meant to be heard (not as MIDI files which lack the proper sound), on authentic Ad Lib and Ad Lib compatible sound cards. For this, I recommend the DOS-based player, AdPlay, which can be found [url=http://adplug.sourceforge.net/]here[/url]. There's a WinAMP plugin called AdPlug also available, as well as a player for Linux, but they emulate the sound so if you have an authentic Ad Lib or compatible, make sure to use the DOS player for best sound result.<br /><br />[url=http://adlib.superfighter.com/]Visit the adlib music archive to enjoy quality Ad Lib game soundtracks[/url]<br /><br />For those of you looking for music from id/Apogee games, I don't make rips from these games available since they most often use IMF format for their music, or use DOS4GW which restricts use of my Ad Lib logging software. I do have three songs available from <i>Monster Bash</i>, however, but I am unable to rip additional songs from that game at this time. To enjoy IMF music, you can find a good selection of it at [url=http://chiptunes.back2roots.org/]Melcom's chiptune archive[/url], and of course AdPlay/AdPlug support play of IMF music too.<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-yorp.gif[/img]       Thanks for reading and enjoy the music!<br /><br />- <b>Death Adder</b><br />Webmaster, [url=http://www.superfighter.com/]www.superfighter.com[/url]"
