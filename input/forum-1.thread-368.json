To capture videos, use the newest DOSBox software.<br />To download a video, click on the time.<br />To watch most of these videos you need [url=http://files.filefront.com/ZMBV_Codecrar/;5117423;;/fileinfo.html]ZMBV Codec[/url]. To install it, unpack it and right click the codec file and click Install.<br /><br />*** How to capture videos: ***<br />Use Google to get all neccessary software. Download and install DOSBox 0.65. Go to its directory and open dosbox.conf with Notepad or anything similiar. Change frameskip=0 value to 1. This will make videos capture in 35FPS, not 70FPS, reducing video size significantly. Now you're ready to capture your videos. To do that, load Keen into your DOSBox (by typing \"mount c c:\\keen1directory\", \"c:\" and \"keen1\"). Then just press Ctrl+Alt+F5 to start or stop recording. You should start recording at the main menu and end it after the ending movie. After you have finished recording your movie, you have to compress the audio. To do that, open your video in VirtualDub (or download and install it first). Then choose to have full compression for audio. Choose Lame MP3 codec for compressing (or download and install it first). Choose 64kbps bitrate. Now test if the movie runs well and then just compress it with WinRAR and upload it to a permanent upload site (like Filefront.com).

That shouldn't be too hard to make, right? It'd be one of the best things to happen to the community in ages."

Only threat can be the Big Red guys in 2 or so levels and unexpected pink robots sliding down the poles... And one diagonally sliding crystal near end of one of the levels. Gotta be especially precise in last 2 levels, there are quite a lot places with dangerous jumps. I'm measuring a time of around 25 minutes. I'll get onto it tomorrow perhaps."

I have pulled a video together.<br /><br />The exact time is 6 minutes and 38,519 seconds from the frame Keen appears on map to the frame Keen touches the babysitter.<br /><br />Be prepared to see extreme glitch and clipping error exploiting. Also, this is the only Keen game that features the so-called Impossible Bullet trick, which is done by jumping and shooting a bullet under you and if done correctly you stay in the air and when you shoot up you fly in the sky with the bullet. There is also a number of strange clipping errors. I guess it's all because this game wasn't made by the original developers and wasn't tested exactly good.<br /><br />I guess this run can be improved by anyone with some luck and good timing. You could not take the extra ammo in Guard Post 1 if you were sure you would do every Impossible Bullet on the first try :P<br /><br />Anyway, the video is up. This time I compressed the audio more and made an XviD version too, although it has worse quality and bigger filesize than the ZMBV version, which is weird.<br /><br />[url=http://files.filefront.com/CommanderKeen6_ZMBV_638509/;5141232;;/fileinfo.html]DOWNLOAD ZMBV - 11.41MB[/url]<br />[url=http://files.filefront.com/CommanderKeen6_XviD_638509/;5141319;;/fileinfo.html]DOWNLOAD XviD - 24.54MB[/url]"

Im sure it wouldnt take that much longer without it.<br /><br />By the way sanitars, since this is your thread, perhaps you could edit the first post so that its got a full list of all the videos, name of player, and time. Somting like this.<br /><br /><br /><b>Keen 1</b><br />[url=http://www.google.com]Alex87[/url] - 2:30<br />[url=http://www.yahoo.com]Xtraverse[/url] - 6:30<br /><br /><b>Keen 2</b><br />etc.<br /><br />Anyway i think its really cool to have people recording themselves. I hope to see more!"

In Keen 3 you could beat 3 levels and then be done with, in keen six you needed the rope and grapple, sandwich and basa key to win aside from joes diner.  I'm assuming when you guys say you beat the game in 6 minutes it was using cheat codes?  I can't see any way it'd be possible without the use of free items in six minutes."

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />Without having read those, but I think I am correct anyway, basically you can play the game normally and save the state (basically everything exactly as it is on the screen at that moment) until you die because of hitting an enemy.<br />When that happens, you load the saved state, and try again.<br />If there are 2 enemies next to eachother that you can theoretically fit in between of, but practically can't because it's impossible to be precise enough... now you can anyway because you can just keep on trying until you do it right.<br />Also there are probably ways of doing slow motion stuff.<br /><br />(This makes me think of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, which rocks by the way.)Retodon8<br />Sheep happens!

The other one is abusing death in Spud City after getting the set of Bombs in the sky - I go the the right border of the level and die, finishing the level - that's about 5-10 seconds faster than walking to the left side, although very dangerous - the success of a run attempt will pretty much depend on how the melee and projectile throwing enemies are positioned - I need 1 of them, preferably the Frenchy positioned as close to the right border as possible while the others are easily disposable. Though it's not very likely.<br /><br />I'd expect a time of about 5:30"
