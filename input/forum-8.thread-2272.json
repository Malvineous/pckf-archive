Cuz get this, one time I saw a site hoster advertise that they had unlimited bandwith.....and then when i finally found a terms of service or policy thing, they said something like \"excessive bandwith usage will be terminated\" GARG!<br /><br />For FreePgs:<br />3. e)        Making available copyrighted software which has been \"cracked\" (e.g., copyright protection for the software has been removed)<br />This is a little hard for a host not to use this policy. Um, does that apply to Keen files? (graphics, sounds, music)<br /><br />4. We do not allow any type of applications, programs, software, or MP3 files on our server unless you are the full owner and/or have rights to redistribute the application/file.<br />But can I hotlink to other places or at least give a link to them? this brings up another important question.<br /><br />If I hotlink files, I know the server that has the file will use its bandwith to send it, but what about the server with the actual hotlink? Does that server use bandwith too? I sure hope not.<br /><br />{EDIT:} I just noticed the SiteSled policy has very similar terms.- .... . / ..-  -. .. ...- . .-. ... . / .. ... / - --- .- ... - / .-."

And does hotlinking use your own server's bandwith?; i pray not.<br /><br />If u don't mind alex, gimme a link to your site; oh and check my game post for info on beta testing.- .... . / ..-  -. .. ...- . .-. ... . / .. ... / - --- .- ... - / .-."
