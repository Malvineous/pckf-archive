If he truly loves Keen, he'll release the damn game already![hr][/quote]<br /><br />I actually think the opposite of that. If Tom did have rights to produce one completly new Keen game (assuming it wasn't just the rights to release the exsisting games to pocket/ pc, as I'd read was the intention of the Keen Chronicals), then he wouln't have been able to complete TUIT, and like Zach said, if his new Keen game was successful, iD would just take the rights to make possible sequels (not so they can get rich off Tom's revival of Keen, so to speak, but simply because they only ever allowed Tom one game). <br /><br />I think it shows that Tom truly loves Keen by holding out to get full rights, instead of just a one-off shot at making a new Keen with iD taking away Keen again as soon as that one game's finished.<br /><br />And perhaps I've read the situation wrong like I sometimes do, but that's what I think. Feel free to take little to no notice of it at all.--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"
