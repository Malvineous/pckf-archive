Try resetting TSRs\" or something; sometimes it runs, but the graphics are impossible to see).  I thought I might not have a good version so I tried patching it to version 1.31, and I was told that I had an unrecognized version.  I then tried patching it to 1.0, and was still told that I had an unrecognized version.<br /><br />Is there some third version of Keen 3 out there that I might have a copy of?  My computer came with Keen on it so I've got no way of checking just what it's supposed to be."
