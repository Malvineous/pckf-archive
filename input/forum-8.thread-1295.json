That's because most of my creative juices have been going towards an online project, but I haven't been able to tell anyone because it's not public yet.<br /><br />Well now, it is! www.ClubPenguin.com is online. It's basically an animated chat room targeted towards the 8-13 age group. I realize that's younger than most everyone here, but it's still worth checking out.<br /><br />EDIT: No, I did not create it single-handedly. I am merely the main artist/animator of it. Most every piece of art that's not backgrounds or interface is what I worked on.[url=http://www.screenhog.com]www.screenhog.com[/url]"
