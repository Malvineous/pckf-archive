So I'll be splitting posts, those are not double posts, sorry, see  no other way.<br /><br />Hi, I'm new here (but a great fan of Ck series), and a pixel artist. I'm known in Doom and wolf3D modding communities for my mods, graphics and projects. By the way for keen I've made in the past double resolution sprites of some pickups - can post them if you want.<br /><br />I've started  2 days ago making Keen engine in Game Maker (5.3), somewhat like Shadow Master is doing.<br />The goal is to recreated and support both keen trilogies, as accurate as I can. as it's on Game Maker engine, it'll be open-sourced project and os easily editable/moddable to add more creatures, features, levels, mods.....it's also support splitscreen and 2 player game (coop/dm)."

Currently works - standing, walking ,shooting (including shooting down and such) beside shooting up while standing - that is still buggy.<br /><br />If someone knows GM and want to help - please do. I'm more a graphics artist than a programmer and hate to do programming work. Even if you don't know GML (game maker scripting language) - it's easier than C++ and fast to learn. for example here is a code for shooting as currently implemented:"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  It's a hard challenge, and I don't promice anything, it all depends on many factors including my free time.<br /><br />Shadow Master - I preciate your project more, as if it'll be able to duplicate Keen gameplay it's be far more of a value, as in Game Maker I can't control 100% of everything, and many functions are indeed pre-fabricated. Also GM projects usually take more space and loading time."
