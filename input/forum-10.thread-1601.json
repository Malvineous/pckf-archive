Not something I'm in a hurry to watch again for a while, but like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I didn't regret paying for the ticket.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />The development of the hardware, and the greater ability to express every idea that flies into a programmers head, mean that game creators have made the new games congested with every technique in their power. The basic games behind all this are so blurred that people cant catch up. We should go back to basics  like Pac-Man  and play in an easier, more relaxed way. -Toru Iwatani<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"

		"content": "I saw it today, and...<br /><br />*INHALES DEEPLY*<br /><br /><br />Believe the hype. <br /><br />If you want to see a movie that's fun, light, universally appealing but never condescending or overexplanatory, you gotta see this. Not once does the story slow down or drag into some unncessary &amp; tiresome popcorn-break montage to promote some band's new single, so if you're not watching every second of it, you're not going to get your ass wiped for you like you might expect of Disney. Never short of great moments, gags and wit, it just rolls onto the next gem of greatness before you can nudge the person next to you and say \"LOL\". (Note: Some of these fast-paced gags will go over the heads of younger viewers. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] )<br /><br />If only more movies were like this.<br /><br />(Just don't be too quick to confuse \"intentionally foreboding\" with \"detestably predictable\". me smart != movie dumb)<br /><br /><br />Although -or Because?- I wasn't watching it particularly critically, I thought everything was, visually, spot-on. The direction is deliciously witty, and there's always something extra to spot, even if it is on the third viewing.<br />Unlike previous W&amp;G animations, this one has quite a large cast of characters, and they're all fun to watch and believably human like you'd hope. Especially the melodramatic vicar. He so funny. \"BEWARE, THE MOON\" had me in tears, for all its stupidity.  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img]  <br /><br />The only bit that wasn't quite as good as the rest of the movie was the slightly abrupt ending, but maybe I'm just used to movies that take forever to end, like LOTR3. The bonus features on the DVD also includes a couple of roughed-out alternate endings, so I guess the Aardman team had a lot of workshopping on the ending and chose the one that they reckoned was best.<br /><br />The fact that it's (chiefly) stop-motion animated is great too.<br /><br />Rating: [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-pogo.gif[/img]  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-pogo.gif[/img]  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-pogo.gif[/img]  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-pogo.gif[/img]  [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-pogo.gif[/img]   / 5----------<br />www.StrifeStrips.com!
