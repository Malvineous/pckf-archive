Top, Joules, Slate, and CSS Sam) too, but I'm too lazy to introduce them.<br /><br />Crypto Cat is well known for inventing ciphers whereas D-Dog is good at breaking them.<br /><br /><br /><i>You can also learn about the National Security Agency/Central Security Service - theyre Americas real codemakers and codebreakers. Our Nations leaders and warfighters count on the technology and information they get from NSA/CSS to get their jobs done. Without NSA/CSS, they wouldnt be able to talk to one another without <b>the bad guys</b> listening and they wouldnt be able to figure out what <b>the bad guys</b> were planning.<br /><br />We hope you have lots of fun learning about cryptology and NSA/CSS. You might be part of the next generation of Americas codemakers and codebreakers.</i><br /><br />[url=http://www.nsa.gov/kids/]www.nsa.gov/kids/[/url]<br /><br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  Ah, propaganda-like stuff..<b>Eat your veggies!</b>"
