This image says it all, the 14th available in the cinema near you.<br />King Kong is the story of a giant monkey who ruins a big city fight with a tyrannosaurs and marries a beautiful woman and more of this kind of great plot details.<br />Silly, bubble gum for the brain? Maybe but with Peter Jackson, the man behind Lord of the rings, as director this movie will surely be a beauty. Sin City already proved that a movie can stand on it's look alone and I'm sure that King Kong will be fun as well.<br /><br />Who's going?<br />[url=http://www.kingkongmovie.com/]Official website[/url]-----------------<br />[img]http://jamba.nl/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Rocket.gif[/img]<br />Jamster! rules!"

I won't say it's you.<br /><br />The movies were long without some happenings that were important in the books and with emphasis on unimportant things, like love scenes. Some (not love) scenes were good, but they were only good in themselves, not as part of the movie. And the movie had no message, it wasn't even entertaining for me. The special effects were nice though...  Maybe this is something the masses want.<br /><br />He is a really good director if the income of a movie makes a director good.<br /><br />The problem with this is that average movies make money, even if no-one likes them as much as they would like good ones, and it's easier to sell them for the masses than good movies that only less people like. <br /><br />What does good mean then? It depends on your personal taste, and everyone has different taste. This is why average movies can't be really good, only goodish.[hr]<i>The human brain is not user-friendly...</i>"
