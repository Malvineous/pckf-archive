I just need an artist and someone who's familiar with ROC generally for ideas.<br /><br />Anyone with anything sundry to contribute is welcome to do so, including any questions or comments.<br /><br />I can also say this isn't a pipe dream, without wishing to say too much, disc one was completed tonight.<br /><br />Regards,<br />- Spikehttp://smc.sq7.org - Sierra Music Central - for old Sierra soundtracks (hopefully Apogee too!)"
