All one can sumise is that this is a poll to consider the complete and total legalization of all drugs in a country.<br /><br />Now if this were more specific, Marajuana perhaps, or P, ecstasy, morphine, etc. then a more productive sample of opinions might be gleaned from this poll.<br /><br />In general the legalization of a drug shold take count of three points:<br /><br />1.) Harm: Does the drug cause harm [most do] and if so how much? Is the pleasure gained worth the harm taken? [This is an issue for society as well since everyone must live with the consequences of the drug use.]<br /><br />2.) How effectively will legalization minimize this harm? Will legalization actually decrease the cases of overdose, gang warfare, etc? Or will they increase?<br /><br />3.) Will people accept the change?<br /><br />On this note, yes I would prefer the abolishment of booze and smokes, they cause untold harm. However, point #3 means that this will never happen [well... maybe with ciggies.]<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

Personally, I don't think it is that bad. It is no worse than alcohol. Or that is what people have told me, because I never did it myself. I guess my whole argument is null because of that. I believe if it gets legalized, the stigma will go away and the usage will be lessened.
