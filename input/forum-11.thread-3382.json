So you could change every \"F\" to an \"J\" or a \"t\" if you're John or tom [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] . Something similar holds for the other letters as well.<br />Make sure every line ends with a newline character that Windows uses (CR+LF, 0x0D0A). If you don't understand this, just press Enter [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] .<br />Line 1 enables cheat 1, line 2 enables cheat 2, etc. So when you only want to enable cheat 3, you create the textfile BETA.DAT with as line 3 \"FBIxAs\" and the rest of the file doesn't matter.<br /><br />Cheat 1: In the bottem left corner of the screen a \"2\" appears. What this \"2\" means, I don't know.<br /><br />Cheat 2: At the upper right corner of the screen it shows what kind of bubbles may appear in current the level. The first bubble is a water bubble, then a fire bubble, a lightning bubble and finally an orange E bubble that represents that EXTEND letters may appear in the current level.<br /><br />Cheat 3: Press Alt+A to show which way the bubbles flow.<br /><br />Cheat 4: When Bubble (player 1) is hit and he makes somersaults press F7 for extra health points. When Bobble (player 2) is hit press F8 for extra health points.<br /><br />Cheat 5: Press j to get back 10 levels, J to go 10 levels ahead, m 1 level back, M 1 level ahead. You can use both Shift keys or the Caps Lock key on your keyboard to go from a j to a J.<br /><br />Cheat 6: Something with writing the file COREDUMP.BB, but the game never gets to this code, I think.<br /><br />I think there's also a 7th cheat, but the game never checks it.Groeten van Frenkel<br />Visit [url=http://www.sfprod.cjb.net]The Official S&amp;F Prod.

This also holds for level 30 and 40. When you get to level 50 without ever getting hit, a secret door appears that takes you to level 70.<br />Without the cheats I could get to the first secret room. But with these cheats I can warp to level 30 and go to its secret room and see with my own eyes that the message is exactly the same as in the secret rooms of level 20 and 40. And the secret door in level 50 really does take you to level 70.<br /><br />They also say there are multiple endings in Bubble Bobble, but I don't see them. But looking through BUBBOB.DAT, I do see some text that indicates that there are supposed to be multiple endings in this version as well.Groeten van Frenkel<br />Visit [url=http://www.sfprod.cjb.net]The Official S&amp;F Prod.
