So here it is:<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]  <b>Keen 1 Level Competition</b> [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mischief.gif[/img] <br /><br />The competition will close on 1st January 2007. Before that the entries should be sent to me via e-mail to keenrush [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopekeen.gif[/img]  keengrid [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopekeen.gif[/img]  net.<br /><br />After that I'll make a level pack of the entries and post it somewhere here in the forums. Then I'll make a topic about the voting -- but more about that once it's its time.<br /><br />It's forbidden to upload or post levels anywhere before the level pack is released. And, the levels need to be new ones, especially made for this competition. Only one level per Keener.<br /><br />The point is to make an old-school, as well as you can, <i>Keen 1 level</i>. The player should be able to complete the level mainly without using the pogo stick (but there may be one or two jumps that require him to pogo) -- but in such case the player may not get all the candy available. Using the collectiable Bean-with-Bacon parts in the level is forbidden. Try to have Keen 1 spirit in the level! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-rasta.gif[/img] <br />Don't use any tile in your level that wasn't used in the original Keen 1 levels -- that meaning, don't use the world map tiles in your level, for example.<br /><br />Keen will start each level with zero ammo and without the pogo!<br /><br />Any questions? Good luck, and have fun!
