The yellow-skinned family's big-screen debut was announced in a teaser trailer that ran ahead of US screenings of Ice Age 2: The Meltdown<br /> <br />The 25-second clip opens with an \"S\" that resembles Superman's insignia, then widens to reveal Homer slumped on the family couch in his underpants. \"I forgot what I was supposed to say,\" he says.<br /><br />The teaser, which was also broadcast on the Fox network on Sunday night, closes by announcing the US release date of the movie.<br /><br />Rumours of a Simpsons silver screen adventure have been circulating for more than a decade. Two years ago, the animated sitcom's producers finally confirmed a film was in the works. But could a movie ever live up to the TV show?<br /><br />\"I can absolutely guarantee that this film will far exceed the wildest expectations of every Simpsons fan,\" said producer Al Jean. \"Start lining up at the theatre now - preferably in costume.\" [url=http://www.ironmaiden.com][img]http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a199/rorie1983/ironmaiden.jpg[/img][/url]<br /><br />[url=http://simplythebest.net/fonts/fonts/font_downloads/iron_maiden.zip]Download the Iron Maiden font[/url]"
