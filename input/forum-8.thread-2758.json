To protect his identity though, I shall refer to him simply as \"Mr.H\" so no one will know who I am talking about.<br /><br />When Mr.H first appeared on the forums he started flooding the PCKF with such pointless topics as \"What got me interested in (insert subject here) anyway.\" or \"My new idea!\". At first I thought that he was actually the one called \"it\" or better known as \"Shockshund\". But after repeated posts without some kind of \"shock\" in them I came to this very startling realization. <br /><br /><i>MR.H IS ACTUALLY AN AGENT OF \"IT\"!</i><br /><br />For months \"it\" has been observing Mr.H on various forums. Mr.H is never able to stay in one place because of the community banding together and throwing him out. \"it\" decided that this is the best agent he could of ever wished for. \"it\" told Mr.H about the PCKF and told him to just \"be himself.\" \"it\" knowing that the PCKF members are too nice to ever kick a member out and would never be able to tell Mr.H what they think about his antics. This will lead to the entire PCKF committing Suicide. Then the torrent of news coverage on how a simple computer game character made fans commit suicide would force ID to never make another Commander Keen again.<br /><br />This is the ultimate goal.-----------------------<br />\"The Adventures of Commander Keen\" issue #1: [img]http://img93.imageshack.us/img93/8904/wid1kx.png[/img]<br />\"Fat people buy lots\""
