Because every sound has a priority which indicates if another osund is stopped or so (u can notice that if u die or get a life)<br />Thanks in advance..<br /><br />[url=http://home.arcor.de/panthele/peter/back.zip]Download v0.02[/url]<br /><br /><br />MfG<br />OnkelPeterle"

And sorry for the dll's: this is because i compiled a debug-enabled-version (and no retail-version - so u'll need the debug-dll's from the msvcrt). The next version should run without that extra dlls [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />MfG<br /><br />PS: I've uploaded a new exe which should use only the normal versions of the dlls (so without the ending 'D': MSVCIRT.dll, MSVCRT.dll, and MSVCP60.dll) which everyone of u should already have on his system..."
