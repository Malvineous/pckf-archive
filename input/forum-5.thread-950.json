The Vortininjas, on the other hand, are frequently placed in locations that offer no geographic advantage or shelter... They also take more shots to kill.  My vote goes to the Ninja."

On the other hand, Vorticon Elite guards can jump too, and shoot, but they're more predictable and avoidable, at least in their native (Keen 2 Vorticon Mothership) environment<br /><br />And Vortininjas can jump even higher too.------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].
