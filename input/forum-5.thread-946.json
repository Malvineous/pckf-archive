It can be done. Differences in personality, likes, hobbies or actions? Easy enough to fake. In the end, how can I prove I'm not LL? What would be conclusive evidence? Certainly I've seen two keeners so far use another identity somewhere else, not on this board, but still, it would have been easy enough.<br /><br />And of course I like Jazz Jackrabbit; I've been playing it for years, Adis had the only computer in our neighborhood, so we had the same games (Including Keen.) for 5 years.
