Other times I prefer slow, instrumental music. Techno/rock ballads I'd say would come out on top most of the time, but it's hard to determine--there's so much awesome stuff out there and music is such a subjective experience.<br /><br />I'm not really too fond of the alternative and hiphop scenes at the moment. There's just something about them that grates against me... maybe something to do with the rhythm not synchronising with the melody... they just seem disjointed... or something.
