Keen 5 has nice music, but it doesn't impress me the way Keen 6's music does.<br /><br />Bloogton Mfg. must have the best music in the Keen series.  If for no other reason than that it fits its level so well.  The Bloogbase music is super awesome also, and one doesn't really care so much that it's very short.  The Domes of Darkness and Guard Posts have the kind of mellow (?) music that stands in good contrast to the more energetic music of other levels.  (The Bloogton Tower music, I must agree, is rather weak, if not annoying.)"
