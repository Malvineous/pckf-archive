They don't use the (slower) CGA draw routines or anything.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure Keen 6 v1.5 will Just Run in CGA on certain IBM EGA cards that had a CGA mode selectable via jumper (they did some sort of palette clamping)."

The other version, on the other hand clearly states that it is a commercial product.<br /><br />If the patch would be released then anyone could get their hands on the registered version, as a download link for the 1.93 version of Keen Dreams is available from here.<br /><br />Of course these things should be decided by the admins."
