		"content": "That's a very comprehensive list, Q90, and I'm all for using that as a template. I think it could do with some further Keenishness, and some simplifications, as it seems like a lot of categories to keep track of (just MKO, of course). Then again, lots of categories would be rather interesting.<br /><br />It might be interesting to do something different to \"Best X\", even if it's just a different name. For example, with the recent level pack competitions, there were Garging (hardest), Yorping (easiest) and Keenish categories. Hearing the word \"Best\" over and over during awards ceremonies just irritates me.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />[1-3]<br />.1 Unique Mod/Fangame<br />.2 Shiny Graphics<br />.3 Canon Award (i.e. Keenish Storyline)<br />.4-6 Keen Mod of the Year YYYY<br />.7 Drool Award 2005-7 for (Modding, Fangame)<br /><br />And let's not forget things like fan art and comic strips! <br /><br />Some other ideas:<br /><b>Foob Award</b><br />For useless, but somehow classy or amusing works<br /><b>Garg Award</b><br />Notoriously difficult prod that's also a great overall piece of work<br /><b>Off The Map</b><br />In the spirit of \"Most Psychedelic\"<br /><br />Who's up for seeking out all(ish) the works from the past three years and compiling a list? It's probably a good plan to begin with to gather a couple of us and take a category each.<br /><br />What qualifies a fan game? Need it be completed? An anticipation award could be offered for incomplete games, so things are a bit more even."
