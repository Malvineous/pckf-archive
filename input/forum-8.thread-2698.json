Thus immediately apon opening the box the other box's wave function collapses, information is transmitted and the box ceases to be a quantum object.

TMST made a fun joke about this, although the post and thread has been gone for a long time already.<br /><br />\"You're 15? Holy Cats!!! You look at least 17... though girls mature faster than guys (physically, not morrally [as in LL's case])\"<br />Well, one's norms and values most probably will never be the same than some other's.. And as well, it's BS in my opinion to claim that males mature faster mentally than females.
