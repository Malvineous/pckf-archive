Having to do everything with the mouse just irritates me--I need keyboard shortcuts and such in order to work effectively. Though I did create this a couple of years ago:<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v192/Jimage/drawage/cliffplex.png[/img]<br /><br />TGF's image editor appeals to me much more:<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v192/Jimage/drawage/TGF-bucket.png[/img]<br /><br />The right-click colour selection feature and convenient palette window are two of the nicest features, along with all the tools being listed along the left instead of hidden in menus. Not to mention I work better with a limited palette.<br /><br />It's interesting how many people might say, \"A Paint utility would be easy to make.\" Why are there none that can replace it? Unfortunately, those that attempt to end up getting dragged off on that 'photo-editing' waterslide and create something that's far less usable for pixel art.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just too picky."
