Clicking on that link brings me to the Inbox, obviously, and in the upper left corner of that new screen, there should be a link that says \"back to: Public Commander Keen Forum,\" because that's where I came from, right? <br /><br />Does it actually say that for you guys?  <br /><br />Because my EzInbox evidently thinks I've been visiting some... less family-oriented sites.  O_o;  I'll post a screenshot if I'm the only one with a funky EzInbox.  What've you guys got on yours?"
