It can make things look reasonable...<br /><br />Now, about the site.<br />- The colour scheme is horrible. Avoid fully red/green/blue/yellow/pink colours, always use a darker or lighter shade. Green, blue and \"pink\" have RGB 0,255,0; 0,0,255; 255,0,255. See the relation? Avoid 255 vs 0, because these colours are eye-hurting and contrasting too much!<br />- Don't resize images on your page, in fact, don't give them fixed sizes at all in the HTML tags. Just let the images display on their original size. Anything else will make it look ugly.<br />- You resized tons of stuff in that one logo image. Avoid. Keep everything at a scale of 100% or 200%, but don't resize to something like 124% because that will make the resized graphics look ugly.<br />- Don't overdo the dots................... It's kinda annoying reading text that way...................<br />- Use a font that looks nice. Arial, Verdana, heck, maybe even Times. But avoid non-truetype fonts like Fixedsys.<br />- Barely any content. Only some text about what the games are, but no downloads, no further info, no fanfic/fanart... I don't really see for what purpose you made this other than explaining with lots of dots what Keen is all about.<br /><br />In short, work seriously on a good site if you want people to be interested and visit/come back to the site.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: sfafsfs?
