		"content": "Yes, Microangelo is one of the best icon manipulation programs out there, but unfortunately it's a 30-day trial which is a pain.  But it will create .icl files (Icon Libraries) which combine multiple icons into a single file (in the same way as say pifmgr.dll has a bunch of icons in it, or moricons.dll from the win3.1 days.)<br /><br />I grabbed a few game-related icons some years back that didn't exist at the time and combined them into one of these files.  They don't look as good as the ones memsys did, but if you're interested I'll post the file to save someone the hassle of extracting and converting the images themselves:<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/pckf/games_icl.png[/img]<br /><br />Not all the images are exactly 32x32 which is why some of them look a little distorted - I figured having larger sizes would make things look better for people using larger icons, like 48x48.  They were originally for my game editor though, so where possible I was aiming for a 16x16 image I could overlay on top of a folder icon, to represent a game's data files.<br /><br />I also used Microangelo animator to make a couple of 256-colour animated cursors - one of the Duke3D nuclear symbol spinning around (the one used on the Duke3D main menu), the Shadow Warrior shuriken spinning, and the rotating yin/yang symbol used on the Shadow Warrior main menu.  Certainly looks better than an hourglass while you're waiting for Windows to do stuff [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]"

The reason it works is because Windows uses both bitmaps and icons internally all over the place (e.g. dialog boxes) so they've become more or less interchangeable.  I also recall the formats being very similar apart from the initial header (since the .ico format allows multiple images of different sizes) so .ico files essentially contain multiple .bmp images minus most of the .bmp header.<br /><br />Of course if you try to use a program that *expects* .ico files and give it a .bmp image you'll run into problems..."

I used to use Borland C++ 5.0.  I recall hearing something about Microsoft's latest IDE being released for free, so you might even be able to use that (but it's certainly not as simple as Microangelo is.)<br /><br />Anyway, you can download [url=http://www.shikadi.net/pckf/Games.icl]Games.icl[/url] from the screenshot above if you're still interested."
