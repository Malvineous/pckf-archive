Most of the games BARELY have a plotline (I'm looking at YOU final fantasy 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9.) and they are ALL EXACTLY the same. You would expect some sort of new gameplay but it never changes. Random battles... same menu selections... same magic... same items... same commands.<br /><br />Over<br /><br />And OVER<br /><br /><br />Again!<br /><br />And especially random battles. Final Fantasy is like the Chineese Food of RPGs. It sucks but people think it is good because they don't know any better.<br /><br />But a ROLE PLAYING GAME can also be a first person shooter. For example Deus Ex? (Oooh forgot about that didn't you?) RPGs are also point and click games like Kings Quest and Monkey Island. You ever hear of \"[url=http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/evn/]NOVA[/url]?\" I doubt it. That is an RPG.<br /><br />What about Baldurs Gate 1 and 2? Icewind Dale? Neverwinter Nights? DIABLO?! Guild Wars. World of Warcraft. Well of Souls? Come on. Final Fantasy is at the absolute lowest rung of RPGs... just face it. It might be good but there is MUCH better out there.<br /><br />But with all this slander AGAINST Final Fantasy I have to admit it isn't unenjoyable. In fact Final Fantasy 6 is one of the coolest games I have played. It is in my list of top 10 favorite games.<br /><br />To be honest I think one of the greatest RPGs I ever played was Solar Winds by epic. That was an amazing game.<br /><br />Ah but to reiterate my opinion...Oblivion is better than Gothic 3.-----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."
