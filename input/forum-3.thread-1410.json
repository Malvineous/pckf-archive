[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smoke2.gif[/img]       You need those in voting.<br /><br />After you've played and carefully marked down the numbers of the levels of your choice, post here (and don't vote your own level in case you're one of the level makers!) and tell the level identification numbers in the following categories (you can vote the same level in more than one category if you wish to).<br /><br /><b>The Most Keenish</b> [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dexter.gif[/img]      <br /><i>The level with the most old-school Keen 1 feeling in it!</i><br /><b>The Most Garging</b> [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img]      <br /><i>The most difficult or challenging or the most complex level!</i><br /><b>The Most Yorping</b> [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-yorp.gif[/img]      <br /><i>The level that was the most pleasing and/or calming to the mind and eye.</i><br /><br />Anyways, big thanks to everyone who made a level, there's 16 excellent levels in this pack! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-drool.gif[/img]       Be sure to check it out!<br />Great to see there was a lot interest in the community for making a level pack, and it seems this attracted many people who had never made a level before to try it out and make one. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]      <br /><br />Have fun! This seems like a great start for the new year (2007), I'm sure it'll be a Keen year. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-birthday.gif[/img]     <br /><br />Edit: I updated the zip; I made an infinite lives patch and added it to the patch file -- I think it fits this well, as the point is to play through different individual levels, not through a set of levels.<br /><br />I also modified the voting category descriptions a bit..<br /><br />Also, as some of you will notice, some people used tiles that were forbidden to use, but I guess it doesn't really matter so much, so those levels are still in, and so on. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]     <br /><br />The voting will end on <b>February 3rd</b>!3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be. I <b>don't consider</b> that GBA game canon by any means.\""

Certain parts were garish to look at, like the cyan ceiling so close to the fortress's spires, but the shape of the levels and the clarity with which it was laid out were very old-school.<br /><i>Runners up: Level 6</i> (Deja vu everywhere, but too easy) and <i>Level 4</i> (Visually very Keen1 at the beginning, but got too hard too fast, completely dissolved by the time the player got the pogo.)<br />Honorable mention: 12<br /><br /><b>Most Garging: Level 1!</b>  The \"gotcha\" tile right before the exit after all that hard work, and the insane tileset mixing going on are simply cruel.  This level is too big, too arbitrary, and too frustrating.<br /><i>Runners up: Level 15</i> (quite possibly as un-Keen as you can get) and <i>Level 11</i> (the rules clearly said \"no map tiles in levels.\")<br />Honorable Mention: Level 2<br /><br /><b>Most Yorping: Level 8!</b>  I really enjoyed the simple thematic use of green, and the flow of the level seemed very natural to me--I did it all on my first try without dying!  Simple, short, and effective.  Kudos!<br /><i>Runners up: Level 7</i> (Nice pacing and design, though the exit was a let-down, the way it was) and <i>Level 5</i> (incredibly cute, but far too short--one of the few times I think there should have been MORE to a level!)<br />Honorable mention: 16<br /><br />I have to say that Levels 9, 10, and 14 were all far too large and long for my liking.  I felt lost, confused, and overwhelmed all at once at any given time in them.<br /><br />The Joker award goes to 13--I jumped into the ice, made a sandwich, jumped up a few times and beat the level.  Was the rest of it even playtested?  How do you get out from opening the blue keycard door without a pogo?<br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"

The fact that a player could choose to pass your level by jumping into the ice rig, waiting it out, and then completing a few simple hops, to me, was the \"lazy\" way of passing it. <br /><br />I certainly don't think you should yank it from the level pack, and I'm very sorry if I hurt your feelings."

Although Xky can be very rude in his posts without knowing, in his heart hes a good guy. So I can forgive him for that if hed apologize to me too. <br /><br />Okay comments about the levels, I got tired of trying some over again.<br />Level 1: I guess I missed that gotcha tile so that one didnt bother. Its a nice well playable level in my opinion that suffers from its hugeness. Searching for some missing key card all over the place isnt fun on the size. <br />Level 2: Was to hard for me. I kept dying well jumping under the hanging green stuff. I didnt finish it.<br />Level 3: The lack of ammo in this level was no fun and made it almost unplayable for me. <b>Garg award</b><br />Level 4: The running up for the Garg award. The jumping for the blue key card drove me crazy. <br />Level 5: Was absolutely no challenge, thats a problem<br />Level 6: Was good but not much of a challenge unless you go exploring.<br />Level 7: Was also good, but maybe a bit to much jumping over huge walls.<br />Level 8: Was nice, no complains. It wasnt so difficult so Ill give it the <b>Yorp award.</b><br />Level 9: That killer robot on the ice bugged, the rest was all right.<br />Level 10: This level was also nice, but like the first one its to big. The searching for key cards was annoying and afterwards the level went on and on and on. I died somewhere at the end and didnt want to try again.<br />Level 11: A huge level, but because of the difficulties I had at the begin, I really didnt come far.<br />Level 12:  Didnt offer much of a challenge. <br />Level 13: Was the worst level Ive ever seen. OMG, its so worse I cant believe it. <br />On a more serious note: to bad that the pogo is missing, the level could have been better. On the other hand making two exists so easily reached doesnt make the level much of a challenge. <br />Level 14: Was nice. I loved the charging Garges. However this level is also to big, so I didnt finish it. From what Ive seen its still the most Keenish level. <b>So thats a Keen award</b><br />Level 15: I liked the way the tiles were used, and the traps. What I didnt like was the jumping over single blocks to get a key card, that part was frustrating. Honourable mentioning for the Garg award.<br />Level 16: Nice overall level and very compact.<br /><br />Oh my, now I reviewed my own level.<br />-----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Falling.gif[/img]"

It's also easy to miss the green keycard.<br /><br />02: Very colorful, but the green vines make the level extremely difficult. The ice jumps and single tile jumps make this incredibly tricky. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img]  <b>GARG AWARD</b><br /><br />03: The dodging at the start is no fun, and the fact that the only ammunition requires you to lure a garg off ice. The jumping into the garg pit for the keycard makes the level VERY difficult.<br /><br />04: Every keycard in the level is difficult to get. The blue requires a series of difficult jumps, the red takes a tricky jump over a patpat if you don't notice the cracked tile, the yellow wants a series of garg pits, the green needs you to be exposed to 3 robots. If that doesn't get you, there is a vorticon waiting by the exit. <i>Honourable mention for the garg award</i><br /><br />05: A nice quick level that reminds me of one of those earlier yorp rooms in keen1. It can either be played fast, or be explored for more goodies.<br /><br />06: Again, can be played fast or you can explore. very nice so <i>Honourable mention for the yorp award</i><br /><br />07: Excellent level, very open and the (not so secret) secret passageway at the end was a nice touch.<br /><br />08: A nice straight forward level. I liked the primary color of green. <br /><br />09: It takes a while to go backwards and forwards in this level, but it was still quite good.<br /><br />10: Very big, and the hunt for the keycards make the level very difficult. I died at the vorticon on the ice near the bottom, and didn't finish the level.<br /><br />11: Another very big level. A nice use of the red block tileinfo to create interesting situations. Would have been a yorp award but the level was too tricky.<br /><br />12: A very nice short level, and the fire boxes were nicely placed. <i>Honourable mention for the Keen award</i><br /><br />13: There are over 151 thousand points availible in this level! I like the way the raygun was placed so it was immediately gained. A pity about the pogo, and the Teddy Bears could do with changing to smaller valued items, but otherwise a very nice level.<br /><br />14: I loved this level. It was very big, but I still think It reminds me the most of keen1.

Just so you know...<br /><br /><br /><b>Edit:</b><br /><br />Here's my votes:<br /><br /><i><b>Yorping</b> - Level 16:</i> This level was the most visually pleasing. I unfortunately cannot put my finger on why precisely (the way the tiles were used with each other was obviously a factor), but it just looked and felt enjoyable to play. <br /><br />I'm sorry that I couldn't explain this one in as much detail as I have for the two others.<br /><br /><br /><i><b>Garging</b> - Level 3:</i> I died many times trying to avoid the first Garg without any weapon or pogo. I did manage to make the jump eventually, only to discover that I needed to make the jump a second time, after collecting the red keycard. It's fortunate that this jump occured very early on in the level, as having to re-play the level many times after actually completing most of it would be even more frustrating.<br /><br />Having said that, the level did look quite pleasing to the eye, and felt rather Keenish. But the area it scored highest in was difficulty, so that's why I've voted for it in this category.<br /><br /><br /><i><b>Keenish</b> - Level 8:</i> This level seemed very Keenish to me. All of the tiles 'suited' -for lack of a better word- each other well, and the layout and useage of the tiles looked like something I'd expect to find in Keen 1.<br /><br />Items and enemies were used sparingly and in 'logical' places, and there were no potentially lethal 'blind falls' (that I can remember, at least) anywhere in the level."

		"content": "Grrg, it was so difficult to choose.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img]   Well, here's my comments and votes. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Level 1: One of my favourites, great design, complexity and chaoxity. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   <b>The Most Garging</b> because of that (even if I manage to get through it easily [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  ).<br />Level 2: Cool level, has some old-school feeling in it.<br />Level 3: A quality ice level, especially like the underground fortress.<br />Level 4: Excellent, although a bit difficult level. I'll give it <b>The Most Keenish</b> as it is pretty Keenish by its design despite the difficulty.<br />Level 5: Very old-school platformer game design. Great, even if a bit short.<br />Level 6: Quite Keenish.<br />Level 7: Nice level with old-school Keeness (I'm running out of phrases).<br />Level 8: Probably the easist level in this pack.<br />Level 9: Interestinly divided into different floors.<br />Level 10: One of the best levels in my opinion, a huge level with thousands of rooms to investigate. I'll give it <b>The Most Yorping</b> as it was very pleasing to play. Great design.<br />Level 11: A huge maze, quite nice as well.<br />Level 12: Great old-school ice level!<br />Level 13: The pyramid is quite interesting idea!<br />Level 14: Another huge good level.<br />Level 15: Pretty chaotic and challenging as well.<br />Level 16: Small Keenish level, great work!3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be. I <b>don't consider</b> that GBA game canon by any means.\""
