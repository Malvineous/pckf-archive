For example, at the very beginning of Ion Ventilation Center, because you hop from pole to pole, you actually get the downward-moving platform onscreen earlier than it needs to, and you have to fall a bit further than is optimal to land on it--if you instead jogged across the platform where the Sparky is, IP'ed up to snag the one long pole, and hopped off quickly, you could land on that platform a tiny bit sooner.  Then, gauge your pogo heights a bit more accurately so you don't lose time waiting for Keen to fall back down.  <br /><br />I've been lurking over at the TAS Videos forum over the past year or so ( http://tasvideos.org ) and it's a vicious perfectionist thing to do, speedrunning.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>  The presentation of this video does a good job of highlighting the exciting parts, and the combination of remixed music and sweep effect keep the pacing nice... <br /><br />But if you want this to be honestly considered, as a speedrun, you're gonna have to encode the whole 'boring' thing, start to finish, with no saves/loads.  <img src=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif?ttinline=true\"/>"
