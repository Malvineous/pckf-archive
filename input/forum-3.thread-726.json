Not just any movie - a Commander Keen Movie. This will be live-action using the game plot and lots of original ideas in there (ie backstory to keen, more 'realistic' etc) and pretty spectacular effects. The movie is slated to be finished by Autumn 2007.<br /><br />In case you are worried it will be naff I will shortlist my film-making experience: 2 films in my local cinema, Regional and National film award, several commissions and an honorary award. I am also a MAJOR keen fan so will deffo make it good.<br /><br />The current status is that I have almost finalised a script and will shortly begin casting. I fully intend on letting the community in on it, hence I am telling you all about it.<br /><br />As proof-of-word I present you with a very-very-very- early teaser poster that my FX guy came up with. Website and plenty of info will be online over summer, will keep you guys posted<br /><br />[img noborder][url=http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=137189694&size=l[/img]www.flickr.com/photo_zoom...ize=l[/img[/url]]<br /><br />High-Res version available upon request<br /><br />Regards,"

A movie like this in the hands of an independent filmmaker sounds extremely promising [we can rest assured it won't turn out like DOOM].<br /><br />Which episodes will you be covering? And how closely will the movie follow the actual gameplay? You should be able to cover all the core levels, since an episode can be speedrun in about 15 minutes, but I'm curious as to how you'll abstract them into the context of a movie.<br /><br />Good luck. Do keep us informed."

I intend to go to the London Film School after my studies (a contact is sponsoring me from the industry)<br /><br />I have plenty of aliens and funny looking planets in my script, I am now going through the process of seeing what is feasible and what isnt. Depending on funding decides whether we have aliens in (costumes etc). I know good locations to film in for alien worlds (mountains, gravelpits, sandunes, rocky mountains) so the environments will look realistic.<br /><br />I intend to stick very closely to the plot of 'Goodbye Galaxy'. The film will be 'self contained' as to speak, by which I mean I will include his backstory, expand on his adventures in space (eg  going to burger joints on other planets) etc so people who do not know of Commander Keen can still enjoy it.<br /><br />There will also be more action/adventure elements in it, one example is of a space-battle, big explosions etc.<br /><br />Any further questions please ask [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

I would think it would be hard not to make a real-life versions of cartoon characters cheesy... but the teaser posters look amazing, so that's a good sign I guess [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />One thing I just realized is that, since matlarsen is from the UK, Commander Keen will be British, won't he?

It is about 11 mins long and weighs about 11 megs.<br /><br />It is literally raw from a digital piano and thus includes a lot of mistakes. Its also a very early on work just testing themes but it provides a good overview of what the music in the film will be like.<br /><br />Trailer shot still being worked on, still taking a bugger of a long time to render and apparently its crashing a lot. Will upload a few screenies of the bean n bacon rocket in the trailer later on tho. It will of course be in HD [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br />Regards,"

Lots of stuff in real life to contend with (had to dash down to London quite a bit, sorting out house which im moving into, family etc). I also just secured a commission over the summer for my student union making the fresher DVD, proceeds of which are being piped into this film.<br /><br />Good news is that I have a few weeks of doing piss all in which I can REALLY focus on this thing. I intend on getting some sort of website up and raising funds to make it. For all movie buffs I have secured a Canon XL1-s to shoot the thing in. Ok its not HD, but its an f'ing good camera for a student :P<br /><br />Thank you to all who liked the music [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]  More will be on its way soon, including a properly mixed version of the bloogwater theme.<br /><br />Might have a few issues with the cast. Main problem being they are in Southampton and I am in Manchester / London. I have scored a few good actors up here however, and will be popping round local drama places with the script. Hopefully I will get a shooting schedule by the end of August ready for a September / December shoot.<br /><br />I have a question to ask the fans: The script I have written can be interpreted as a comedy or as a parody - which would you prefer? Comedy as in it is funny, or parody as in it rips on other sci-fi movies as well as Commander Keen.<br /><br />Thank you for your continued support [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />Regards,"

Lonely music in the background (almost montage scene).<br />Keen flies the ship past amazing space backdrops. Camera back to Keen, he<br />is looking sad. His console starts beeping. He snaps out of his daydream and<br />looks at the monitor. He then gasps and looks out the window. A strange<br />electrial storm is approaching and fast, like a tear in space. Keen tries<br />to escape but cant, all his controls get knocked out. Keen stares out his<br />side window in fear as the tear overwhelms him.<br /><br />Bright light, white screen. The room then turns into a small metallic cabin,<br />with smooth metal walls and floor. He is lying on a bed. The room has some<br />scientists in it monitoring computers, a small radar dish pointed at his bed.<br /><br />A scientist approaches<br /><br />Unknown<br />Hello there! You ok?<br /><br />Keen (groans)<br />Where am I?<br /><br />Unknown<br />Your in a hospital, we cought you falling into the tear and took you here<br />before you caused a traffic jam.<br /><br />Keen (half awake, confused)<br />What the...?<br /><br />Unknown (frowns)<br />What universe you from?<br /><br />Keen <br />I'm from 'the universe' universe?<br /><br />Unknown<br />Ah yes, your the only universe that was so un-imaginative, that they decided to call it 'the universe'.<br /><br />Keen <br />What you on about.<br /><br />Uknown<br />Oh yes, you lot are causing a lot of problems at the inter-dimension summit.<br /><br />Keen <br />Err.. where am I?<br /><br />Unknown<br />(sighs) Oh yes, I forgot. Here, let me explain...<br /><br />You know the theory that there could be multiple dimensions that sometimes tear open in places?<br /><br />Keen <br />Like black holes?<br /><br />Unknown<br />Got it, now, our people a long time ago figured out how to get through to the over side. That was billions of years ago. Now most of them are used up.<br /><br />Keen <br />What, thats impossible!<br /><br />Unknown<br />Oh its nothing special, people gotta commute aint they?<br /><br />Keen<br />Aren't there infinite universes?<br /><br />Unknown<br />Well, there's enough room left for another trillion years or so. Oh dear. Ok, this is why you shouldnt be here. You know about the Vorticans and the Galactic Alliance right?<br /><br />Keen (nodding)<br />Ok, thats all of modern physics proved wrong just now, but yeah...<br /><br />Unknown<br />Well imagine the same thing between universes. Your universe is considered an 'anomoly'<br /><br />Keen (stll in amazement, worried)<br />Is that bad?<br /><br />Unknown<br />Yes<br /><br />Keen <br />Why so bad?<br /><br />Unknown<br />Because we are on the verge of an interdimensional war.<br /><br />Keen <br />Ah.<br /><br />The two sides dispute your universe. It was ignored on the most because your all so stupid. For that reason neither side claimed it. Now they want it. Well, they don't really, they just want to piss us off. It's all just a load of bollocks really...<br /><br />(keen is still in amazement)<br /><br />they've all agreed that to end the tension we should just blow up your universe, let no-one have it. No-one gives a toss about you really.<br /><br />Keen <br />Whoa Whoa Whoa, your saying we could be wiped out any instant?<br /><br />Unknown (shrugs)<br />Decision was made last week<br /><br />Keen (open mouthed and alarmed)<br />You have GOT to be shitting me.<br /><br /><br />Room around Keen fades away and leaves him on a table in a cottage looking over temperate waterfall on an alien planet. The room is full of people wearing cardboard box outfits like robots.<br /><br /><br />RobotMan 1 (jumps and puts hands in air out to keen)<br />April Fool!<br /><br />======="

It isnt going to work. I couldnt think of a situation where it would look normal for an 8-year-old to do half the stuff in the games, let alone a movie adaptation.<br /><br />In that pic he is wearing a cycle helmet as we were unable to secure an American Football helmet.<br /><br />I thought that as it is an older keen, it would be better to place him in older-style clothes. Make him look a bit trendy even. Meh, when you see the film you will get it :P<br /><br />EDIT: (Imagine a cross between hitch-hikers and commander keen, thats sort of what the movie will be like, with a lot more sarcasm thrown in)"
