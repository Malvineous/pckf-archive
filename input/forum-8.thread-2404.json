		"content": "Well, most of my time could be considered 'spare', so I do a lot. Lots of it involves a wide variety of computers. Old games, new games (though IMKO the on-shelf gaming situation is looking rather bleak at the moment), coding games, watching demos... whatever the hell I happen to be interested in at the time.<br /><br />Generally my non-computer endeavours involve creating things. Drawing stuff, building monuments out of random stuff, domino rallies (using either plastic dominos or my collection of Tic Tac containers, or both), writing... again, whatever captures my interest.<br /><br />When I'm not doing any of the above, I just hang out with friends doing random stuff. Movies, cards (we play Skip Bo a lot), mini golf (not so much any more--it got overdone), go-karts (I prefer not to because the dude that runs them is a tightarse and half the go-karts don't run at their proper speed), gatherings, etc.<br /><br />Most people I know seem to really enjoy alcohol for some reason, so a lot of drunken parties take place. Unfortunately, they all seem to be wage-slaves nowadays, thus parties are fairly tame. \"Naw, can't come. I've got work in the morning\".[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-rolleyes.gif[/img] <br /><br />Funny thing is, it's these very people who are always complaining about not having enough time and money to do this or that. *shrugs*<br /><br />Anyway, I do all sorts of interesting stuff in my spare time. A lot of it is fairly frivulous, and many of my projects are public domain, but most is leading toward things that will make me more money and allow me to live comfortably without eventually joining the \"working class\".<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />A concerned member of the Preservation of Endangered Spleens Society<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
