Unfortunately I've never been a big Led Zeppelin fan, so I have no clue which it might be...<br /><br />My computer has been inaccessable for the past week, and will most likely be so for the next month (I'm using a public terminal), could you list the names of the other Jill songs?  I think I could pinpoint which sounds like the NiN song merely from the name..."

		"content": "It's because they're CMF files, which the AdPlug plugin supports (also Winamp's built in MIDI plugin used to be able to play them as MIDIs, but I don't know if that's still the case - either way they don't sound so good with MIDI instruments, kinda like IMFs.)<br /><br />They should be renamed to *.CMF but evidently AdPlug isn't so fussy.  You should be able to do the same with the Kiloblaster and Xargon music, which are also CMF files.<br /><br />Unfortunately AdPlug doesn't properly support one of the key features in CMF files, so if you compare FUNKY.DDT with the in-game map music you'll really notice the difference."
