		"content": "Avoiding showing the character's legs in 2D might be less work, but in 3D, it's still very helpful to animate the legs anyways, simply so that you know where the body should be. You don't have to animate the legs well if you can't see them, but animate them well enough that you know where the body should be. In most action, the thrust of the body comes from the hips, and to know how high the hips are off the ground, you need to still know where the feet should be.<br /><br />The key to making lip sync work isn't in whether or not the character is pointing in your direction, it's in the body language. What you're saying is 50% determined by how you act. In fact, many animators, when starting a lip sync scene, perfect the body motion first before touching the face -- that's a must in 2D animation, actually. When I'm doing 3D lip-sync animation, I usually do the face first, but I still focus on the body in the long run.<br /><br />Note to self: talking about animation makes me want to do some. Remind me of this the next time I'm in an animation slump.[url=http://www.screenhog.com]www.screenhog.com[/url]"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  What I've linked is box modelling too. The main idea is to create a box or any basic object and start from there. It's nothing more. You can extrude the faces, create new edges etc.  from that afterwards.<br /><br />I used to creating 3D models but I never was quiet good in it so I gave up. There's only a few images I've finished. But I read the forums and tutorials at [url=http://www.3dtotal.com]3dtotal[/url] often. It's a nice source of information to begin with."

Episode I was a mediocre movie by itself, but George Lucas completely threw his reputation away with the incredibly AWFUL Episode II.  Hopefully Episode III will be better...[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dexter.gif[/img] <br /><br />But I'm getting off-topic.  I think a castle modeled like the ones on the second trilogy of SW would look good.  The only image I can form of the Keen4 opening castle is how it was seen in Ilsoap's Rule of a Yorp's Supper, surrounded by desert with a few trees and cliffs in the distance, with the castle itself being kind of orangey brick like the Keen4 pyramids.  I still think that game is genius...<br /><br />But do whatever you want to DSL!  We already trust you enough in making things look Keenish to let you go wild!

		"content": "A Star Wars inspired city is a safe bet. We came to the same conclusion over at K:M for the Community Mod project, with a bit of a Tyrian spin on it.<br /><br />[hr]<b>KeenRush</b> Yes, and the Oracle is a machine. I have always imagined that place as something big city, where the building touch the clouds, and Oracle is on a roof of some of them. (Like that one city in for example Star Wars: Episode 1!)<br />[hr]<br /><br />[hr]<b>Yowza</b> As for the Oracle - I always thought of it as being on a Coruscant-ish city aswell. Maybe we could have it set a little less west.. Perhaps where the 'civilised' part of Gnosticus IV ends, and where the Shadowlands begin.<br />[hr]<br /><br />[hr]<b>Lemur</b> A Gnosticene city would also be a fun level, especially if it were floating. It could be a bunch of buildings over a pit (if that's possible). That's a bit premature for this planning phase, so I'll hold the thought.<br />[hr]<br /><br />[hr]<b>Yowza</b> Although, I was thinking of something more like Coruscant from Star Wars... But with most of the buildings on floating rocks. Basically, the earlier levels would be closer to the ground (or water), and the levels would consist of being in the buildings, and jumping between them. Gradually, you would get higher up in the buildings, and possibly even revisit ones you've already been too (but way higher up). <br />[hr]<br /><br />[hr]<b>ScizorCT</b> I was thinking more along the lines of Miragia, from Commander Keen, but floating. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br />*ducks flying bricks* <br />[hr]<br /><br />[hr]<b>Me</b> some of the stuff found in Tyrian could make for the basis of some interesting CKCM ideas... <br /><br />[...] Gravitium ore is very similar to the stuff found on Gnosticene. It fits perfectly into the storyline of both Keen4 and the CKCM.<br />[hr]<br /><br />[hr]<b>ScizorCT</b> Let's say that on Gnosticus IV, a combination of odd tectonic forces and gravitational pull have made possible the existence of an element that is capable of quite a bit more than your average rock. Through a bit of research, the Gnosticines discovered that it could be used to A. Make stuff float, and B. Fiddle with time. The first discovery of this element was when the Lifewater Oasis first appeared: A mineral spring bubbling up from the depths of the planet, which may or may not have anything to do with the Ancients being immortal, but that's beside the point. Mining operations later found more of it, although under incredible pressure and uncomfortably close to large pockets of magma. Unfortuately, a few foolhardy miners blasted through to some magma, which resulted in the entire operation being shut down. The Chasm of Chills and Cave of Descendants can be seen as the remnants of the earlier mining. Later operations were further east, preferably as far from the Shadowlands as possible. What was finally mined of the material was transported to the city and mostly used to make it float, thus defending it from most of the monsters on the planet.<br />[hr]<br /><br />[hr]<b>Lemur</b> Maybe the city could be divided into multiple districs or something that are connected by water tunnels that dip down under water.<br />[hr]<br /><br />[hr]<b>ScizorCT</b> The more I've thought about it, the more it seems like that idea fits into the Shadowlands though. Out by the Lifewater Oasis are Sand Yego and Miragia. Why? Perhaps Sand Yego was once the stockhold for the mined ore before being shipped elsewhere. It seems like Miragia is an abandoned test site for the ore, really. Some really funky stuff occurs there with no real reason why, and the scenery there is found no where else in the Shadowlands. Perhaps the Wetsuit was once used to explore the Oasis? At any rate, I'd be willing to wager that Miragia would be a good basis for the city graphics of Ep. 3. Still, other locations like the Perilous Pit (looks as much like a mineshaft as anything I've seen) and the Isle of Tar (deep with huge tar pits. Sound like a failed shaft to you?) just seem logical.<br />[hr]<br /><br />Well, there's some food for thought. It'll be awesome to see this stuff in full 3D.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />JimSoft Lair<br />http://jimsoft.spatang.com/"
