		"content": "Ugh. Deviant Art.<br /><br />The chin's too pointy/square. Keen's head is rounder. The nose should probably be more curved, and slightly U-shaped. It's not a rule, but that's the style used in the original art so it's a lot easier to get the impression across.<br /><br />Eyes go in the middle of the head (though you can always choose to break this rule as part of your style if you wish). The expression looks good. You might want to add a slightly larger highlight to the pupils to give him a bit more life.<br /><br />If you use a separate layer to sketch the underlying structure of the head, position the features and design the hair so you can actually make it an outline rather than just a scribble. Makes things a lot easier. You often need to do a bit of trial and error to get things looking right.<br /><br />Looks like you've at least got the coordination, you just need to work on the planning. It's quick and easy to sketch up a general impression of something, and then once you have the wider scope of the drawing done, the outline and further details are easy.<br /><br />That said, looks alright. It's not stunning, but it looks like Keen closer to 13, and 'looks like' is the main thing."

There are many pretty neat Keen pieces at DA that are never seen here because their authors' don't care about Keen enough to search for Keen stuff or join here and preview, or anything.
