I would just, first, copy everything onto my computer, and organiza it. Then I'd make a list of every poster, and then create user for them. All you need to do is activate them.

They aren't fun at all, although knowing you the purpose is to annoy as much as possible.<br /><br />And to add, not everyone can design web pages right from the start.
