Where does it stand in relation to the other Keen games?<br /><br />Hopefully the poll choices are adequate, I'm not sure if five is really enough or if I've given the right options. I'm playing Keen Dreams now (sort of), so I'll post my thoughts and/or answer the poll a bit later.------------------<br />[url=http://www.ericmushroomwilson.co.uk/] My website[/url]<br />[url=http://ericmushroom.livejournal.com/]My stupid journal thing[/url]"

For example, some graphics are IDENTICAL to Keen 4 graphics (rocky ground, etc.), there's no pogo and you can't \"shoot\" your opponents. You throw things at them instead, and the effect is temporary. That was disappointing for me the first time I played it. There are some cool discoveries in its engine, though. For example, you see the \"loading level\" progress bar in Bio Menace too, and the main menu has some sort of different layout. Impressing mouse cursor, btw. Kee4-6 and Bio Menace had mouse support, but none of them displayed an actual mouse cursor like Keen Dreams did. The engine is very similar to Keen4's, except for the worldmap functionality. The \"this area is for entering level X\" spots are hardcoded in the engine (I mean, they are predefined info-plane values that can't be modified except by patching the binary, while in Keen4-6 you could write the info-plane values for each level entrance directly, and they weren't restricted to predefined info-plane values/sprites).<br />(message cutted to half. word count maximum exceeded)------------------<br /><b>SM:</b> <i>\"I could go and write a page about the Theory of Relativity (or whatever it's called), but, what is the point if I don't know what the Theory of Relativity is?\"</i><br /><br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]"
