Well, whoever wants to test can.<br /><br />Hopefully this will prevent people getting embarresed in front of others (sure, very likely, since we don't see each other at all), but even more hopefully limiting all tests, however few they are, to one post may avoid an event of spoiling another topic with a bunch of code gone wrong.<br /><br />Translation: KeenEmpire doesn't want to repeat the blowing up of eK's topic and get banned.<br /><br />The very first test here is...aha, my sig!<br /><br />(PS, last time KeenEmpire put about ten failed sigs in eK's topic...wait...did I say that already?)<br /><br />Go with whatever little testing you have, peeps!<br /><br />Edit: As a response to realization that people are still making new testing topics, I have suspended retirement to update the title into something more...catchy.<br /><br />Edit PS: The retirement might not be real!  :P____________________________________________________<br /><br />[img]http://www.fileplanet.com/shots/31769.jpg[/img]<br />Hmmm, I thought the White Tower would be a little more...white.<br />Please click at least once: [url=http://creaturecology.com/getcard.asp?ecologist=MS&creature=Marc%20IVI%20Survivor]here[/url], [url=http://creaturecology.com/getcard.asp?ecologist=MS&creature=Desert%20Claw]here[/url], [url=http://creaturecology.com/getcard.asp?ecologist=MS&creature=Headless%20Hunter]here[/url], and [url=http://creaturecology.com/getcard.asp?ecologist=MS&creature=A%20Effort%20of%20reach]and here[/url]."
