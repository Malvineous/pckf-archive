It has a lot of advanced features in it.<br /><br />[url=http://www.noteworthysoftware.com/]www.noteworthysoftware.com/[/url]<br /><br />You can either buy the full version or just download the free trial. The difference is the free trial only lets you save like... five times or something. You can get around this by making a new file and copy-paste everything into the new one. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img] <br /><br />I never tried the other suggestions though. I'll have to look into them later.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Blegdandsmeegdbanner60copy.gif[/img][/url]"
