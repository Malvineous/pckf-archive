I sometimes wonder if it's just Id Software that controls our minds using Mortimer's mind-belts in order to prevent us from resurrecting Keen, but anyway, making Keen stuff seems to be non-sense nowadays. What's the point anyway?------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-confused.gif[/img] <br /><br />But yeah, iD has definitely something to do with it, for years they've fiddled with my mind and tried to stop my modding. They've been close.

But also, you have to see that people for different reasons, for example because of their changing interests or lack of time, priorities, abandon their Keen work -- we can't (or at least shouldn't) expect them to do the same thing forever. Even I'll be gone one day.

Wolf3d is  an old game as well, but it's modding gets only more intense over the years, as code was released people all the time come up with new ideas, features.<br />We need source code, or good open-soursed keen recreation.<br /><br />Also tools for keen4-6 editing seem to be much weaker than for keen1-3 editing. And keen 1-3 have very little enemy selection, which makes keen1-3 modding less fun.<br /><br />Well, at least in my case - I'm definetely in the mood for Keen.<br />But I hate mapping, I love only graphic work. So I can help a project graphically, but probably won't have keen mod of my own.<br />And Shadow Master - it'll help motivating people like me if you'd post some responce when me for example post new graphics update in modding area. If you like it, not....some feedback. I then you wonder why people leave"

In addition, of all the Keen fangames that have been coded from scratch, Isis II is pretty much the most complete (damn us lazy Keeners).<br /><br />The only games I'm aware of that can compete with its awesomeness are Real Keen Player 3 and Z-1's Keen engine. However, RKP3's storyline doesn't fit into the Keen universe, and Z-Keen is still just a engine rather than an entirely playable game.<br /><br />In short, it's a must play, despite its incomplete nature."
