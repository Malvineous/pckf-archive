I did some of the characters a little differently to the existing font, (like the Z) as I think it's more like the official Keen 3 translation.  Coming up with a decent way to do the C and the S was a bit tricky though.<br /><br />Once I've touched it up a bit I'll release the .TTF file if anyone's interested."

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />In other words, since the SGA itself isn't really a \"font\", multiple variations are a good thing.<br />As long as they don't all have the exact same file name, preferable not the same font name either, it'll work nicely too.<br />It's nice having a more rounded one like Malvineous's as well.<br />It reminds me of neon signs, probably because those usually have rounded letters due to the technology used.<br /><br />I studied the SGA \"X\" for a bit, as in K6 the dot is somewhat above the dash, whereas in K3 it is really next to it.<br />Tom Hall's scan is like concept art, something that isn't necessarily canon, since it might not make it to its intended game, or at least not in the exact same version.<br />K6 is newer, but then again it's a more low res rendition of the font, so maybe K3's more high res version should take precedence.<br /><br />I was making my own version of the font... I needed to study SGA closely. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br />Thanks for the compliment, SpikeNexus, I'm glad you like it.<br />I really made my own version because I like doing things myself in case I ever use it for bigger projects, and because some things in the original bugged me.<br />I also made it because I wanted to add some extra pictographs like I mentioned above.<br />Until I actually work on that, its hasn't really a good reason for existing, but...

I was also thinking of doing a Times New Roman style in SGA, or possibly a kids' slightly messy handwritten style as well.  I tried doing an LCD-style one (like you might get if you tried to draw the SGA on a calculator) but it didn't come out too well - the reason being I tried to get all letters to fit on the *same* LCD layout.  While this would be how it works in real life, it'd look better in a font if you used some artistic license and didn't stick to the same segment layout for each letter.  Perhaps another day...<br /><br />And yes Ret, your font does look good, although little things like the X being slightly smaller than the rest of the letters is the sort of thing that bothers me and is quite tedious to fix.<br /><br />As to the variation in the X, you could always use both glyphs and just put one as uppercase and one as lowercase."

As a little extra history (as best as I can remember it) the SGA was never actually going to happen. However, as Keen 1 was being made, they were making the tile for the EXIT sign beside the exit door, and thought it'd be fun to mix it up a bit and make it look alien. (This is why the letters in \"exit\" look somewhat similar to our alphabet.) After doing this, they decided to continue it to the rest of the alphabet.<br /><br />Another fun fact... the only letter that doesn't appear in SGA in Keen 5 is the letter Z.[url=http://www.screenhog.com]www.screenhog.com[/url]"
