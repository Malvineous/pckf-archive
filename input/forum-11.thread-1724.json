Why do they make games, then quit making those games, and then leave them in limbo?<br /><br />I mean, why not make it freeware?  Hell, if you aren't selling it and you have no intention to, then why, WHY?, would you not allow people to have it?<br /><br />I mean, if there's not a profit to be made... Can't they just let go?<br /><br /><br />Bio Menace took years to become freeware, and I don't even know if Bio2 and Bio3 ever became freeware!  Btu what was the point?  They just quit selling it and then left it to die.<br /><br /><br />It's almost like Commander Keen 6.  The company owns the rights to it, but they just leave it on the shelf for no reason.<br /><br />Halloween Harry, as near as I can remember, was an excellent games.  I remember playing it a few years ago... But now it's illegal to download it under any circumstances?  What kind of shit is that?<br /><br /><br />Does anyone think there is any logic to doing this?"

In order to sell a product, there needs to be two things: Supply and demand.<br />B. They have the supply.  Currently the demand is me and about 1,000 (approx) other oldie gamers.  1,000 (Or even 20,000) games isn't enough to start re-making these labels.<br />C. Therefore there is no profit in making these games.  You can't have profit when there isn't any (notable) demand.<br /><br /><br />I mean, is it even slightly forseable that there will ever be a \"retro-game renesciance\" that could ever come close to building a demand?<br /><br /><br />That's my point.  There is never going to be a demand, and therefore no profit.  So if there's no profit, there's no reason to worry about lawbreakers, etc.  If they release it as freeware, it still leaves them open to make other games (Like a huge collection of Apogee games on GBA or something, or completely new ones like they do with Duke Nukem.)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

I used to read manuals all the time back in the DOS days, but now you don't get as much to read. Although, I have noticed some games are starting to include more interesting stuff than just some cardboard and a CD. Problem is, a lot of them I'm not interested is... games have been fairly dismal for half a decade (excluding strategy/sim games, which are, in general, retaining a high level of both quality and quantity).<br /><br />Anyway... my point is, if I can't get a hard copy of something I'll get a pirated one. I'm not sure if that point is relevant to this discussion, but I've typed it now and I don't feel like backtracking."

If so, get a Visa Debit card through St. George bank.  It has Visa number so can be used as a Credit Card for net stuff, but you can only use the money you've put on there, so you aren't using money you don't have.  Also, if you're a student there's no fees on it.  Wonderful stuff."
