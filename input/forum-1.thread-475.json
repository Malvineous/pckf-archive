I felt so very smart back when I was 11, figuring out how to do that.  :-)  <br /><br />Looking at it now, a decade later, I still enjoy it because of the way things are place throughout the level... it's a good mix of \"optional but deadly points\" and \"passages which aren't long enough to be LHS but are very simple nonetheless.\"  It's also got a secret after the exit which I appreciate.<br /><br />Ironically, my favorite Keen2 level doesn't have a single Scrub in it.  :-)[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"
