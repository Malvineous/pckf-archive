The document explains that eros and agape are both inherently good, but that eros risks being downgraded to mere sex if it is not balanced by an element of spiritual Christianity.</i>\"<br /><br />The point of this topic?

It would be nice if it didn't. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br />Eros = erotic form of love (sexual love). <br />Agape = love for somebody in such a way that does not consider yourself. Often self sacrificing love. Think of somebody who jumps in front of a bus to shove somebody else away - they know they will die, but they are saving that other person.<br /><br />Odd that it has to be said over and over again that sexual love is a good thing. Honestly, when I first read that quote you provided, I thought it was a copy of something I read 3 years ago. (I had a theology class titled \"Christian Love\" at a prominent Catholic university.)<br />This is an example of what a lot of people use as an excuse to stay away from any kind of \"religion\": Churches and Christians have so many rules about what you <i>can't</i> do. We're often so busy making sure we aren't doing bad things (and unfortunately often watching for somebody else to do bad things) that we forget the real purpose.<br />Of course, some folks also seem too busy working on the things they <i>must</i> do - rules that have developed at one time or another and been adopted, that they to some degree disagree with the book that defines and is the authoritative reference for their beliefs.<br /><br /><br />It's also quite interesting that he uses Nietzsche as part of his opinion."
