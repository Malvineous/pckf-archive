There's a big difference between the kind of violence of Tom &amp; Jerry and the Doom violence.<br /><br />And the German versions lack two levels probably because it referenced Wolfenstein 3D. Wolf 3D was NEVER distributed in Germany, and guess why. It isn't too difficult. What kind of people the main character is killing in the game? It starts with an 'N' and ends with an 'I'.<br /><br />EDIT: Sarah, by the way, Keen is only 8 years old, and I think it would qualify as an infant.[hr]<b>SM:</b> <i>\"I could go and write a page about the Theory of Relativity (or whatever it's called), but, what is the point if I don't know what the Theory of Relativity is?\"</i><br /><br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]"
