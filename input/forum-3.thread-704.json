		"content": "I've had a little web project in the works for a few months with the intention of replacing the Keen Newsletter. Aside from the obvious 'getting a round TUIT', the difficult part is deciding what constitutes news, and how to categorise everything.<br /><br />Looking at the recent threads here, there are a few things that stand out. But there are also bits and pieces that probably wouldn't interest a wide audience. *shrugs*<br /><br />The plan is to have two types of content--announcements and articles. It will be similar in style to www.osnews.com, with the main purpose of keeping those who don't visit the PCKF frequently, and non-Keeners, informed about what's going on. With the Keen wiki in action now, the scope can be narrowed down a lot, but the concept is still rather tangled in my head."

It'll be called \"Grabbiter\" and will use those RSS feeds or whatever they are.
