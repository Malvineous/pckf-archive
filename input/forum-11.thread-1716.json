The only thing I don't know is what two of the languages are; should someone be multi-lingual and recognises one of 'em let me know and I'll fix the folder names.<br /><br />Important: the ripper extracts the WAVs into the current directory - so you *must* extract the exe somewhere before you use it, don't simply run it from within the zip or the extracted files will end up god knows where.<br /><br />Enjoy.------------------<br />[url=http://www.szevvy.net]www.szevvy.net[/url], for all your Wombat needs.
