		"content": "Hello I am High School student and I am new to this board. I have been a Commander Keen fan about 12 years now. <br /><br />And yesterday I started from scratch (minus some textures) to make a 3D Commander Keen games. Since there are not alot of them finished right now (is Keen Dreams 3D the only one?), I thought I would try something that hasn't been done that much.<br /><br />Current project:<br />Right now I am working on one level that you guys can play, and if all goes well it will be done by next week. It will, hopefully, set the rules for any future 3D Commander Keen games I make.<br /><br />Here are some screenshots. I am open to any *constructive* criticisim. So please do not be vague in your critiques.<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/Tirqin/Keen1a.jpg[/img]<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/Tirqin/Keen2a.jpg[/img]<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/Tirqin/Keen3a.jpg[/img]<br /><br />I am trying to get this game to be most like the Vortican Trilogy as possible, gameplay and graphically. But of course I have to take some creative liberties, after all I am working with 3D models based on a 2d game.<br /><br />I will hope that this game will be one of quality and that I would learn from this experience to help me with other game development projects I work on.<br /><br />Also I would like to contribute my 3d art for people to use as a resource. If the final models are deemed acceptable by this community.<br /><br />Future Projects:<br /><br />After this level I would like to remake the first level of Commander Keen 1, if not the game (that would be too big for me right now). I also wouldn't mind making a completely new game.<br /><br />Tools I am using:<br /><br />To program the game I am using Blitz3d. For models I am using Wings3D. For animation I am using anim8or. And for levels I using Maplet, a BlitzBasic based map program (you can find it on the Blitz site).<br /><br />[url=http://blitzbasic.com/]blitzbasic.com/[/url]<br />[url=http://wings3d.com/]wings3d.com/[/url]<br /><br />Other Work:<br /><br />Here are some links to other games I have made and art I have made:<br /><br />[url=http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v337/Tirqin/?sc=1&multi=1&addtype=local&media=image]smg.photobucket.com/album...edia=image[/url]<br />[url=http://www.christiancoders.com/cgi-bin/ubb-cgi/postdisplay.cgi?forum=Forum4&topic=000289]www.christiancoders.com/c...pic=000289[/url]<br />[url=http://www.christiancoders.com/cgi-bin/sc/showcase_showentry.pl?id=lava06052006153933&comments=no]www.christiancoders.com/c...omments=no[/url]<br />[url=http://www.christiancoders.com/cgi-bin/sc/showcase_showentry.pl?id=lava12292005213343&comments=no]www.christiancoders.com/c...omments=no[/url]<br />[url=http://www.christiancoders.com/cgi-bin/sc/showcase_showentry.pl?id=lava06092006141200&comments=no]www.christiancoders.com/c...omments=no[/url]"

Okay then...<br /><br />Firstly you'll want to use larger tiles then you're currently using; the tiles in the 2D game were about half Keen's height, so thats what you should aim for.<br /><br />Secondly, make Keens helemt more round and sphereical; and his face not so flat and lego man like.<br /><br />If its possible some sort of background would be a good idea; for example Jazz Jackrabbit 1's 3D bonus levels warp a 4 tile block to create the ilusion of mountains around the level. [This is a warp I've seen copied many times] For now though, black seems to go with everything.<br /><br />I must admit, for a game only a day or two old, thats pretty damn impressive!<br /><br />I look forward to seeing its completion.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"

		"content": "Ok the model changes, I decided to make those on the polishing stage, so after the level and gameplay is done but before the animation is finished.  I have edits to make on Yorp, Pizza, Keen and possibly the soda cans.<br /><br />Right now I am working on the level, I made the level, but there might be some problems with the distances and jumping. After that I will have to do some lighting, the level will be lightmapped and then work on the item placement.<br /><br />Then I will work on the gun's function and enemy AI. Which BTW, does anyone know how the yorps are supposed to act? They seem really random, sometimes they follow you and sometimes they go in a pattern, in Keen 1. That would be alot of help. I won't make the yorps move their eyes like they do in Keen 1, that would be kinda hard and strange to translate into 3D, but I want to at least imitate their behavior patterns.<br /><br />About the tiles, I have made them bigger and they look great. But like DaVince said, it doesn't match a 3D but then like KeenRush said, it's cool to keep the original tiles. So, I made my own tiles, same design and colors as the original but cleaner and less pixelated. I *hope* that is the best of both worlds.<br /><br />I think it would be interesting to see the game with really advanced textures. And I am capable of it. But that would take alot of time and right now I want to keep things simple.<br /><br />@ freeyorp101 <br /><br />Well, in the behind position it was hard to see the laser and give a good pic at the same time. But the reason the laser is short is because the game will usually be behind Keen, so it looks short because you are behind the laser. It was short in the side pic because I just move the camera around and you could see the gun pose and laser being shot.<br /><br />Hmm, a glow would be interesting. I'll see how that can be done and how it looks.<br /><br />Well the pointy blocks idea sounds cool, but I cant do it in my map editor, I can made ramp shapes, but not a pyramid where everything is distributed evenly. And if I made the X and Z sides pointed, I would have to make the bottom and top pointed too, which would make it hard to climb on.<br /><br />@ memsys <br /><br />How so? [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]    <br /><br />But thanks guys, for all of the compliments, encouragement, and criticisim. It has been a big help and I really appreciate it [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]    . I hope to make this the best Keen 3D."

But that just my opinion.<br /><br />About the yorp movement.. I think they move towards the x-coordinate of the player but walk past the point by a random amount of pixels. Then they do their \"thinking\" or whatever that movement is, and turn around, and walk towards the player x-coords. On their way they do little jumps. And if you jump on them they're stunned for a while (this would be cool feature to see in this game!).3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be.

(I know it isn't easy to do)<br /> * If possible, model his face rather than having it as a flat texture applied to the front of his head.<br /> * Make his helmet slightly more round. (Reference pictures: [url=http://images.google.com/images?q=green+bay+packers+helmet]images.google.com/images?q=green+bay+packers+helmet[/url])<br /><br />The only other change I can suggest is that you redraw the texture for the blocks - not necessarily changing how they look, just giving them a higher resolution - rather than use the original tiles from the old games. These minor criticisms aside, great job!

Mainly because the animations. For this demo I want to have really high quality animations. But I cant do that till I get Milkshape. My friend and I entered a game making contest a while ago, and the judges are still judging, so if I win one of the categories I could win Milkshape, but if not, I won't be able to get it until (at the most), Christmas. <br /><br />Of course the alternative would be to make animations manually with my modeller, and just set up a system in Blitz to show each frame every so much seconds. But that method usually doesn't produce alot of quality in the animations. <br /><br />It's up to you guys, should I make manual, lower quality animations? Or should I make higher qualty animations, when I get Milkshape? <br /><br />I hate having to take this long, especially since the demo isn't that big. So it would be a big disappointment."

I'm not sure how animation works in Blitz3D, if you have to define every frame of the animation or if it performs automatic interpolation or what, but you can probably find a way to make Blender work with it. The only bad part about Blender is that there's a pretty high learning curve, so it'll take you a while to learn how to use it, but it's a very powerful program."
