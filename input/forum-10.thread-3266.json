		"content": "Yeah, and an amazing band at that.  Robert Fripp just got done playing the G3 tour with Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, not to mention their bass players (that's right, they have two) were the first bassists EVER to use the Touchbass.  The whole band is revolutionary.  Back in the late 70's their lead guitarist, Adrian Belew, was one of the first players ever to use the Roland Guitar Synth during live concerts.  Their DVDs are awesome.  Basically, if you're into Progressive Rock or experimental music, you need to know this band.  Have I left anything out?<br /><br />If you're looking for cool bands that you've never heard of, you should check out Jambase.com.
