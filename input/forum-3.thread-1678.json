		"content": "I am making my own Keen sprite![img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   here is my opinion about it so far...<br /><br />Walking animation: Average<br />It looks nice so far but not perfect. The worst thing about it is the fact that his arms only change position when he is shooting, in an ice block, when he dies, and when he uses his pogo, making him look weird when he walks. Don't worry, I will make his arms animate in the walking animation.<br /><br />Jumping animation: Poor<br />When he jumps, his legs shrink! (basically because I'm bad at making jumping animations) Also, his arms might look better if they move as he jumps, but I'm not sure. One more thing. Part of his helmet (the black part at the very top)  disappears at the \"falling\" frame. I don't feel like fixing this.<br /><br />Map animations: Terrible<br />There aren't any new map sprites yet! Yay!<br /><br />Pogo animation: Bad<br />The black part at the very top disappears at the first pogo frame and comes back at the \"pogo landed\" frame. Also, the pogo animation looks (sort of) weird.<br /><br />Ice block animation: Bad<br />The Keen sprite inside the ice looks nice, but it's barely an animation. (His head just flips. That's it.) Also, the ice Keen is in looks horrible.<br /><br />Gun animation: Horrible<br />It is just a walking sprite holding a gun straight out. Boo!<br /><br />Total: Average<br />It's not very good but not very bad either. :P-------------------<br />A proud member of the beta testing society<br />[url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/comics_todays.html]www.garfield.com/comics/comics_todays.html[/url]<br />Down with VGA!
