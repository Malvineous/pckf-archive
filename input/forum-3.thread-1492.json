I tried to get it as close as possible to how it looks in Keen 4-6. I even added retractable landing gear.  After seeing G314's BwB though, I saw I needed something more. So I went ahead and made my own Commander Keen to go with it. I also made a pogo stick and a wrist computer. I couldn't find the correct piece to make a neural stunner (green) so I made the death ray from Keen 1.<br /><br />Then I figured I might as well stretch my imagination and make Mortimer's ship and a Mortimer lego man as well. So I did that. (That took a lot less time for some reason.)<br /><br />I tried making other things like Molly McMire and a yorp but they didn't turn out too well.<br /><br />Can't find the digital camera right now so I'll look for it tomorrow. Now I really need to get back to making my comic. I'll be gone for a few days as I disconnect the interent, unistall all my games and glue my hand to the wacom tablet pen.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] -----------------------<br />\"The Adventures of Commander Keen\" issue #1: [img]http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/3791/yorpcopy0yu.gif[/img](new teaser 7/26)"
