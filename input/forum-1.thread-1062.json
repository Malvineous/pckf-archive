And if you look at the placements of the candy bars vs. the big macs, it makes perfect sense that'd be the case.  But then you check your score each time you get a zitto bar and a big mac, and you see the points are reversed. This is clearly not intentional, and yet it seems to blatant of an error to be in the official game.  And it seems even more unlikely that I'm the only one who has noticed this.<br /><br />I tried downgrading from 1.31 to 1.0, but the bug was in the old version of the game as well.  Kinda takes the fun out of the game. :-/  Get extra lives without any effort, which allows you to stock up on ammo... which kinda makes the whole thing pretty easy when you can blast away and not worry about running out."
