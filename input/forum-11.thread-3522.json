[I think the CD version start has about 60 animations, they're hard to discern, so I'm not trying anytime soon.]<br /><br />To get those images out took a bit of work; Wombat will get a discoloured image out of any 0SC file renamed CHEAT.0SC, but it comes with assorted junk and as I said, discoloured. I made a small [Okay, huge] program to edit the outputted bitmaps to restore normal colour and cut the junk. The discolouration is usualy 'standard' but in some cases it varies meaning I had to give the program some screenshots to calibrate it.<br /><br />Once again, much thanks, Wombat is appreciated.

Where can I get it?<br /><br />As far as I can figure out, the animations are merely a series of still images compressed along with data on thier location. First Jazz draws the background, then at every 'frame' Jazz simultaneously erases the last image while drawing the next. <br /><br />My brother used a screenshot program coupled with a graphics program to edit the Jazz CD start, all the animation images are here:[ [img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/CDanm.png[/img] ] it really shows how epic made it look like there are more frames then there are.<br /> A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/Kazz.gif[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
