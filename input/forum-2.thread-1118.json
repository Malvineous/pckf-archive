Enemies AI can be easily adjustable to fit keenAI (as there are plenty of enemies (26 to be exact), some of those sure can be good base for keen enemies), and new enemies can be made. Still, collision events and other usually buggy stuff are handled well there.<br />The engine is a bit heavy though."
