It <i>would have</i> been a sign of more Keen to come.  :-)  You may say it \"would of\" when speaking aloud, but when writing it, it's \"would have.\"<br /><br />Part of the charm of Keen, in my opinion, is the amazing environments and atmospheres the iD team created using only 16 colors.  It's truly a demonstration of artistic talent, being able to convey an idea clearly with limited resources.  (My opinion, anyway.)<br /><br />Just keep your eyes on z-1's new game, then, for higher color Keen.  :-)"
