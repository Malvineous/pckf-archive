Too many people sitting on the blessings that the Good Lord intended for everyone, raking in a fortune selling what isn't theirs to people who have a right to it. Take what you need out of life and no more. Leave the rest for those who need it too.\"<br />- Mary Pound (quoted in Reaching for the Other Side by Dawn Hill)<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v192/Jimage/SPASM.gif[/img]<br /><br />JimSoft Lair<br />http://jimsoftlair.tripod.com/"
