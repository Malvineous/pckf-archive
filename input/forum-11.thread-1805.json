They are REALLY wonderful, one of them is called the Battle of Endor, and there are hundreds of incoming TIEs[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mischief.gif[/img]  even interceptors. The models look really good in my opinion, even if it was designed to keep poly-count low. Because:<br /><br />The only flaw is that it requires a PC faster than 1.4GHz. You can expect lower framerates on slower PCs. It works on my small 400MHz PC but it has an about 1FPS. It is flawless on my 2.5GHZ Ati Radeon9600 XP Pro PC (this one)<br /><br />A worth try. Battle of Endor &amp; Battle of Yavin<br /><br />[url=http://www.bruneras.com]www.bruneras.com[/url]<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br />Keep in mind, I'm not an artist."
