[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]  I am making an opensource game called 'Superland' in C++. It features a Keen-like gameplay, with small levels, jumping, shooting and collecting points. Eventually i would like to make some connection to the Keen-games, like introducing the Standard Gallactic Alphabet, or the Dopefish or something. I might even use Billy Blaze somewhere in the story. <br /><br />It is not finished yet, but here is a small gameplay teaser movie:<br />[url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=bmJ_lXNPvx8]youtube.com/watch?v=bmJ_lXNPvx8[/url]<br /><br />The quality sucks, because Youtube compressed it very much. I will post some screenshots here soon, so you can see what the graphics look like. <br /><br /><br />I could use some help from level editors, sprite creators and tile creators. If someone is interested, post it here. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />I put this topic in 'Unofficial Keen games' because it is a Keen-inspired game. If this does not belong in 'Unofficial Keen games' someone may move it to another subforum.
