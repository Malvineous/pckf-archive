		"content": "Hi all,<br /><br />Just remembered something I used to play around with many years ago, and thought it might be of some interest in case nobody else has tried it.<br /><br />In Keen 1 (and possibly Keen2-3, I've only tried it with Keen 1 and 5 and it didn't work in Keen5) there are extra levels you can get to by walking off the edge of the world map.<br /><br />If you put on God Mode and walk off the top of the map, Keen will walk off the screen.  Once he's out of view, just about every point you walk over is a level entry point - if you press Ctrl as if you're normally entering a level, something will happen nearly every time.  Most of the time you'll either respawn at the same point (i.e. go out and instantly back to the map level) or you'll end up in a corrupted level and instantly die, like this:<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_deathlevel.png[/img]<br /><br />I wasn't able to do it this time, but in the past I've found a level like this where Keen doesn't die instantly, but he falls down the screen and dies when he hits the bottom - which means you've got just enough time to put God Mode on and fly around the level to have a look.<br /><br />Sometimes on the off-screen world map you can hit a 'teleporter' and you'll teleport back to one of the three teleporters on the real world map, however when I was fiddling to get these screenshots I ended up teleporting to a corrupted map level:<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_weirdmap.png[/img]<br /><br />Unfortunately when I pressed Ctrl+F5 to take a screenshot, the Ctrl key registered with Keen and I teleported out again before I could have a proper look around [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br /><br />It's gets better though - if you can find the right spot, you can go into the title sequence:<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_titleentry.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_titleship.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_titleship2.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_titleyorp.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_titleteddy1.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_titleteddy2.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_titleteddy3.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://www.shikadi.net/keen1gfx/keen1_title4.png[/img]<br /><br />Have fun [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

In fact, I remember there was a functional teleporter somewhere amongst the tiles which used to be my only way of getting to the secret level. I haven't been able to do the F8 'trick' for years, so those shots bring back memories.

Running around looking for these levels always brings back memories.<br /><br />I've never stumbled across the front-end level, though. This gives me an idea for my mod: level 90 can be accessed from the map screen by inserting sprite #90, while level 80 and 81 fade out and bring up the Keens Left window.
