(Runners up: Levels 6 and 9, each gaining a vote and a runner-up vote.)<br /><b>Scrub Award.</b>  Winner: <b>Level 2</b>, with only two votes.  (Runners up: Levels 5 and 10, with a vote each, and Levels 9 and 11 with a runner-up vote each.)<br /><b>Elite Award.</b>  Winner: <b>Level 7</b>, hands down.  Four votes.  (Runners up: Level 4, with one vote, and Level 8, with two runner-up votes.)<br /><br />Thanks to all who made these levels, and those who participated in voting as well!  The pack was great, helped me de-rust those old skills.<br /><br />Feel free to comment or review or whatever you feel like on this topic from now on.  Also, if Levellass could post the names of the level creators, it'd be great to be able to congratulate the winners properly (and know who else took part). --------------------<br />[url=http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/]Cerebral Cortex 314[/url] - For All of your Commander Keen Needs.<br />[url=http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/dave/joes.html]Eat at Joes[/url]"

Sorry to everyone for my level being a bit difficult, I really had no intention of making it so hard!  While testing it I thought it was a walk in the park [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smoke2.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Some quick comments about my level:<br /><br />Xky brought up the point that the drop into flames by the guard robot was a bit unfair.  I'd have to agree, I originally had it as a safe drop, but I felt that the rest of the level was too easy.  I guess I was wrong.  <br /><br />Also the part with those elites is actually pretty simple, just hide outside the entrance to the room and fire shots in between the blue wall tiles and the white/cyan tiles.<br /><br />In response to DaVince and the red key card: after getting past the guard robot, fall to the left.  Navigate the platforms, kill the grunt, then use the scrub to get the key card.  After that escape by jumping up the green barrels."

		"content": "Mine was Level 10. As with my Keen 1 level, the focus was on atmosphere more than difficulty.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Xky</b> Level 10 -- I'm really torn, here. The level is a visual hodgepodge of map tiles, wasted space, and flashing lights... but the gameplay of the level is fine--pretty enjoyable, in fact! I really don't know what to say; I can't decide if I love it or hate it!<br />[hr]This comment confused me. Where is the visual hodgepodge of map tiles? Just curious.<br /><br />I think we need a different format for the next competition. Perhaps a level size limit, and some way of moderating difficulty. I couldn't complete any of these levels besides my own.<br /><br />It's intriguing that even the most insanely difficult of levels are easy if they're your own. That is a helpful lesson to take from this."

With this in mind I think we'll all be able to make better levels next time around."
