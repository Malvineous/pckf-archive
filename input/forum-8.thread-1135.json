I'm a noob to this community.<br /><br />Like most of you, I played CK when I was 8 years old or something, but I have fond memories of it and occasionally go on big Commander Keen level making crazes--None of them are very good, but hopefully this next round I make will be worth playing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, I am just saying hello. I'm quite impressed at how alive this community is, considering it is centered around a 14 year old side scrolling computer game.<br /><br /><center><b>crymorenub</b></center><br />"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br />And yeah, it's indeed a wonder -- there's no classic game like Keen that has such a fan base, I'm sure. It's amazing how much Keen stuff there is available, from pictures to fan games to mods to levels to editing tools to web sites.. And a lot more.

As Galaxieretter, a great Keener who has since left for military service, would say, \"Keen is more than a game.\"<br /><br />I'd love to see any new levels you create. Maybe you'll find an interest in modding as well. There's a lot that can be done these days to tweak the Keen games into completely new adventures."
