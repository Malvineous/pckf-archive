After installation the program uses about 5 MB disk space. The program requires at least 65000 colors (high color, 16-bit). It requires at least 800x600 screen resolution. A 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 8.0 or higher and with at least 16 MB of video memory is required (preferably 32 MB or more). Also a DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card is required. Make sure all graphics and sound card drivers are up to date. DirectX 8.0 or higher is required.<br /><br />(edit function unavaliable on my first post of this topic, sorry)- .... . &lt;&gt; ..- -. .. ...- . .-. ... . &lt;&gt; .. ... &lt;&gt; - --- .- ... -"

The topic for it was locked within 24 hours.  :-P<br /><br />Edit to be on topic:  Yes, the game runs on my computer, but it was harder to find in the forums than I wanted it to be.  If you're going to make a poll about your game, you should at least link to the download of your game in the post.  For example:<br /><br />Does MortimerInBlack's game, [url=http://planetck.spatang.com/downloads/BWBvsTQD.zip]BWB vs TQD[/url], work on your computer?  Yes/No/Etc.<br /><br />Also, you should Edit/Update the first post of your thread in Unofficial Keen Games to provide a download.  As it is, the only download in the thread is a single-word-long link in one of Genius314's posts.  That makes your game hard to find!!"
