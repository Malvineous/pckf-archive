		"content": "I decided not to spend anytime on RKP4 because of several reasons:<br />even though I do have a lot of spare time now because of the holidays there the last couple of weeks were timeconsuming for my study so I did not do much in the last couple of months.<br />The project does not give me enough challenge as I have spent a lot of time on 2D platformers because of RKP1,2 and 3, so some ideas are recycled and only a few ideas which I could not do before could have added some challenge.<br />I moved over to a new project I'm working on (in silence to avoid \"cease and desist\" letters). A 3D cartoon racer starring famous videogame characters  la \"Mario Kart meets Super Smash Bros\". It does give me the challenge I want and I do like 3D modelling after learning the basics. Commander Keen is a playable character and I added the neural stunner as weapon(might add Dopefish in as weapon as well), but other than a Shadowlands track there's no Commander Keen equivalences.<br />[img]http://www.liacs.nl/~pjordaan/in_keen.png[/img]<br />Commander Keen as he looks right now in the game(could be improved as I did this after a week of modeling knowledge)<br /><br />The last reason is the main reason as it offers me some new challenges: besides Commander Keen driving in the BWB you can play as Duke Nukem in a Dodge Viper, Aiai from Super Monkey Ball in a Ball, Cosmo in an UFO, Mario in a kart, Sonic by foot Amazing Paperboy on a bicycle and several others.  all driving their own vehicles. Their weapons consists of pacman, concrete donkeys, red shells, banana peels, neural stunner bullets and exploding sheep and many other weapons. And the tracks are also from all sorts of videogames.<br />[img]http://www.liacs.nl/~pjordaan/in_mario.png[/img]If Dopefish is for real, what would it be evolved from?"

Yoshi might be funny to add as a power-up that eats cars and turns them into eggs. Tails might be the \"Lakitu\" in the game.<br /><br />As for a new RKP, this karting game is my first experience in 3D, so a good lesson on how to make 3D games. May be after that I might work on a 3D Commander Keen, but that'll take ages before I even start working on such project.<br /><br />Some screenshots(with the first track being the paperboy track)<br />[img]http://www.liacs.nl/~pjordaan/screenshot3.png[/img]<br />[img]http://www.liacs.nl/~pjordaan/screenshot1.png[/img]<br />[img]http://www.liacs.nl/~pjordaan/screenshot2.png[/img]<br />[img]http://www.liacs.nl/~pjordaan/screenshot4.png[/img]If Dopefish is for real, what would it be evolved from?"
