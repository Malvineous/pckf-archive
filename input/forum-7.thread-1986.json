What's this place got to offer?<br /><br />Simple: the people who read the modding section of this forum aren't specialists.  Think about that for a moment--they're the people who are interested in Keen enough to have a passing interest in the fangames and mods that exist, but they're either not technical enough or not interested in the behind-the-scenes stuff enough to go visit K:M.  <br /><br />This is an excellent place to discuss what the un-modding public would like to see in their mods, or to gather input on what players would like to see.<br /><br />So let's get some discussion, or at least some posts, from those of you who never venture over to adurdin's realm: <b>What do you want to see in a mod?</b>  What seperates a mod from a fangame, to you?  Why do you prefer one over the other?  What can mods do to attract your attention?  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />K:M regulars, feel free to jump in with feedback and such, but I'm mainly interested in the posters who don't frequent K:M.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"

Most mods (and fangames) seem to be completely separate from the existing games (sort of like how the only thing linking Invasion of the Vorticons and Goodbye Galaxy is Keen himself.)<br /><br />I would really like to see a mod/fangame revisit the old places Keen has been been before, only set many years after the original games.  It would be interesting to find out what has happened to all the places and characters we know from the old games.  Sort of like \"where are they now?\"  Are the places on Gnosticus IV still bustling with locals?  Have they made changes to their towns and buildings, or have they abandoned some and let them fall to ruin?  A mod like this would be interesting because it should have entirely new graphics, but most of them would remind you of the original Keen games, thus providing the link back to the real Keen universe.<br /><br />Or perhaps the Shikadi have become very angry with Keen for destroying their plans in Keen 5, and are out to get him.  We know what the Shikadi look like, but we've never seen their home planet (although I suspect it would involve a lot of transparency, which might be good for a modder who isn't a particularly great artist [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] )<br /><br />So my point is that connecting the mod to the existing Keen games with both the storyline and the location/characters makes it more interesting for me."

You're the best.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />Apocalypse Gohan, let's get a few things straight here. This thread was asking what you'd like to see in a mod, and how mods can be made more interesting to the general non-modding community.  You responded to this prompt by posting picture after picture of edited sprites, without any real contribution to the topic.  Keen with a sprite from Keen4 sticking out the nozzle of his gun does absolutely nothing to help a mod be made.  Especially not if item number two on your checklist is \"quality.\"  <br /><br />Give me one 'quality' reason why Keen should arm himself with a flamethrower.  One.  It's already been established in this thread that PLOT is relevant to the interest in a mod; if we just say \"Hay guyz Keen hav f;lamz now kewl lol!\" nobody (except maybe you) is going to download and play it.<br /><br />Second, as Spleen pointed out, this forum is about KeenModding, using the Keen games' engine to create new games, possibly about Keen.  If you're looking for QuakeMods, or DoomMods, or any other types of mods BESIDES KeenMods, you should look into another forum. <br /><br />Third, what're you doing posting cut-paste'd screenshots of Mario 3, Keen, and Link?  How does that contribute to discussion of modding, at all?

Why did we even bother making a \"Modding\" subsection of the PCKF, anyway?  If this is the most use it's going to get, this whole thing should be wiped.

Whenever I hop into the FanGames forum, everything I say is theory; I don't make FanGames, I don't use GameMaker, I don't code, and I rarely play them. I view FanGames from a completely outside perspective--but I still contribute to their threads, in hopes a FanGame is made that can catch my interest.[hr][/quote]<br /><b>Very sorry...my mistake.</b><br /><br />Modding doom and making new levels is a fun thing to do for me and having a CD with tools, new graphics and sounds make it even more fun. (editing doom+beavis and butt-head noises=fun)(doom modder)<br /><br /><b>Im sorry.</b><br /><br />When I see the words KeenModding I think using the Keen games to create new games with different game engines and you know new things new game engine. (its all keen here)<br /><br />A 'quality' reason why Keen should arm himself with a flamethrower.....<br /><br />Weapon mods are the best and coolest kind of mods to make, with new grapics and making the enemy explode, melt, implode, set on fire, frozen, electrocuted, and even shooting more ammo then needed at once is very cool.<br /><br />New level designs are also cool, playing the same kind of levels get boring.<br /><br /><b>Sorry, very sorry.</b><br /><br />Quality... (official nintendo seal of quality...heh.)<br /><br />It means just that, crappy and unplayable mods suck and making quality mods matter the most. <br /><br />Quality can refer to<br /><br />a. a specific characteristic of an object (the qualities of ice - i.e. its properties).<br /><br /><b>b</b>. the achievement or excellence of an object (good quality ice - i.e. not of inferior grade).<br /><br />c. the essence of an object (the quality of ice - i.e. \"iceness\").<br /><br />d. the meaning of excellence itself.<br /><br />The first meaning is technical, the second practical, the third artistic and the fourth metaphysical. All four meanings, and therefore the meaning of quality, are synonymous with good.<br /><br />Philosophy and common sense tend to see quality as related either to subjective feelings or to objective facts. The subject-object in question might be a concrete and functional (e.g. Arisotelian) value to be learnt and applied (a and b), or a psychic (e.g. platonic) ideal to be apprehended and represented (c). A third view tends to see quality not as a secondary value that something has, rather a primary truth which comprises apparent subjects and objects (d).<br /><br />So the quality of something depends on the criteria being applied to it. Something might be good because it is useful, because it is beautiful, or simply because it exists. Determining or finding quality therefore involves an understanding of use, beauty and existence - what is useful, what is beautiful and what exists.<br /><br />Hay guyz Keen hav f;lamz now kewl lol! nobody (except maybe you) is going to download and play it.<br /><br />Your right! nobody would play it (except maybe me) and while im at it why dont I make a mod with ice.<br /><br />Commander keen fire and ice mod.<br /><br />Fire and ice!!<br /><br /><b>So very sorry.</b><br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Third, what're you doing posting cut-paste'd screenshots of Mario 3, Keen, and Link? How does that contribute to discussion of modding, at all? Were you expecting people to somehow rally to your side, singing your praise for spending 10 minutes with MS Paint to combine graphics from a few different games? [hr][/quote]<br />If only someone were able to hack a Mario 3 rom and put keen in it. (or dangerous dave)<br /><br />Modding is editing games. (rally to my side and sing my praise, a picture shall be made)<br /><br /><b>Sorry about that.</b><br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]You responded to this prompt by posting picture after picture of edited sprites, without any real contribution to the topic. Keen with a sprite from Keen4 sticking out the nozzle of his gun does absolutely nothing to help a mod be made.[hr][/quote]Hey I just wanted to show what I thought a keen flamethrower mod would look like.<br /><br /><b>Sorry about that too.</b><br /><br />... Why did we even bother making a \"Modding\" subsection of the PCKF, anyway?<br /><br />Because you care.....I guess.<br /><br />I use this subsection the most.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]             <br /><br />Most people on this forum go to K:M.......hmm.      <br /><br />Im <b>sorry</b> XkyRauh2001, <b>very sorry</b> Commander Spleen I ruined your sub-forum and tainted it with the misunderstanding to make some use of this Modding forum, now its less of the object you suggested to get the opinion of non keen modders, it...its poop, its poopy poop, poop now, you can't clean the stain I made! I Soiled the clean pants of your subsection, who would use this brown foul smelling thing to tell you what they think, its the color of failure, fallen on the floor of stupidity and stepped on by the shoe of misuse, woe the sadness of failure is now stuck to that shoe, I defacated upon this sub-forum and stepped in it...<b>I am sorry.</b><br /><br />[hr]<br /><center>KEEN</center><br />[center] [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopekeen.gif[/img]                [/center]<br /><center>DOPE</center>"

The continued use of the keen engine<br />3. The fact that 2,3,5,6 mods can only be propely used by other keen fans and not just anyone who stumbles across it [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mortlol.gif[/img] <br />4. the ideas - an idea for a creature for a mod need to be fit into an existing sprite or patch, but for a fangame it can be adapted to a wider range<br />5. fangames can use complicated puzzles to their advantage, but most keen fans already know about the teleported and falling block, so most mod ingame puzzles need careful thought.<br /><br /><br /><b>* Why do you prefer one over the other?</b><br /><br />1. mods have that keen feel to them- this is difficult to duplicate in a fangame<br />2. the amazement when a particularly good patch is used <br />3. knowing that 16 color art is harder than 256 color art, which is a good challenge<br />4. the levels in mods - the restrictions of tiles mean that you need to be careful, but you can still create good levels. Good levels make a lot of a mod in my opinion<br />5. the knowledge that other keen fans know the game, and the challenge to make it a game which doesn't give everything away (ie if someone sees something bouncing along they think oh its a yorp replacement whereas a patched yorp may look like something new)<br /><br /><br /><b>* What can mods do to attract your attention?</b> <br /><br />1. level design<br />2. graphics<br />3. patches<br />4. storyline<br />5. suprises<br /><br />[hr]<br /><br />---Freeyorp"
