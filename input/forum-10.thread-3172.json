If you hate David Lynch movies, don't see this!<br /><br />I'm still processing the movie in my head and don't really know what to say about it except \"wow.\"<br /><br /><b>El Topo (The Mole) - 1970 - In Spanish with English Subtitles</b><br /><br />I guess I'll try to describe the film a little bit - here are a couple of the more memorable scenes in the movie: The man with no arms with a man with no legs tied onto his back ... together, they function as one person with arms and legs. The priest who plays Russian Roulette during church - if you don't die, it's \"a miracle.\"<br /><br />And lastly, on a more commercial note, John Lennon said that this was his favorite film.<br /><br />Anyone else here seen it? What did you think?"
