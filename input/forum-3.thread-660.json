This month, the theme was PC Games, and someone (I don't know who yet - they remain anonymous during the voting process) submitted a great piano mix of Wednesday at the Beach, from Keen 5.<br /><br />To find it, go to [url=http://dod.vgmix.com/current.php]dod.vgmix.com/current.php[/url] ... (or, if you're reading this after the voting is finished, go to the Past Duels section, and look for August 2007)"
