Give it a go like this:<br /><br />Set screen resolution and ALL graphics options to the Maximum available<br />Also, try to cut back on system performance by, for example, modifying the game's CPU priority to low and running about 10-15 Microsoft Words in the background (or, a Keen game made in Multimedia Fusion or The Games Factory, because these apps use 90-99% of processor speed)<br /><br />Also, play around with switching subtitles on-off and using -or not using- DirectShow."
