		"content": "I'm 16 years old and i've been playing Keen all my life.  My dad got it for my big sister when she was 3 and I started playing it when i was about 4 or 5.  Every so often i'd always come back to the games and 3 years ago my sister and I started what we called Keen Fest.  During summer vacation we (on seperate computers) would do a keen marathon playing every level of all six games (excluding keen dreams) on hard over a 48 hour period with 1 save allowed every 20 minutes in 4,5, and 6.  So far every year i've been able to beat the previous years scores. <br /><br />In short it's a monumental task of incredibly nerdy love.  That's why tonight after finishing the ,still, astonishingly difficult Invasion of the Vorticons trilogy I decided to google search Commander Keen and I found this board.  Can't believe I didn't think of it before.   <br /><br />I've some questions.  There must be more than just the 7 games i own otherwise this board couldn't still be active and have so many posters.  Are there any third party episodes that have been made for keen, is there any news on The Universe is Toast trilogy?  Can anyone link me to any good sites?"

		"content": "Yeah i have to agree, commander keen is an incredible game.<br /><br />I played commander keen lots as a kid too (better make that more than lots). We only had a 386 back then which could only play the really simple dos games (no doom etc., just games like keen, cosmo, jill etc.).<br /><br />I always played keen 5 cause thats what was on my PC.<br /><br />Then eventually the computer died and i didn't play keen for maybe 5 years (maybe more) and i really wanted to play it, so i opened up the 386 and tried to fix it, and with luck i did!<br /><br />It was such an incredible feeling to play that game again, it brang back so many memories. I can't explain how it felt, but it felt great to be playing it again.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much i finished it twice in a row on hard [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] , this is somthing no other game has been able to do to me."

Its basically a program that plays dos games. Its much smoother, fixes sound/music problems in XP, has AA support and lets you record.<br /><br />You can find it [url=http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/download.php?main=1&begaming_website_session=cf236d48dcd160b0f97acbb5c040b5d8]here.[/url]"
