		"content": "1. Yes<br /><br />2. I plan to get more in the future. Something Keen related I think, but I'm not sure what yet.<br /><br />3. There are three dangers that I can think of.<br /><br />First, and most likely, is that you'll regret it later. So think long and hard. Make sure you get something that's close to your heart, and that will stay that way. And if you're feeling like you \"have to\" get one because something is just that important to you, then take a few months to cool off. If you're too excited then you're not thinking clearly, and it's essential that you be rational when contemplating a permanent change to your body. You wouldn't want to regret it later.<br /><br />Second is that it could hurt you socially or in the workplace. Many employers won't allow visible tattoos, and some people might think less of you because of it. If either of these worry you, then make sure you get in a place they won't see it. Somewhere inside your clothes is good.<br /><br />Third, and least likely, is that something would go wrong with the tattooing itself. Allergic reactions to the ink or possible. A tattoo is an *invasive medical procedure*, and as such it carries a risk of infection. More likely than not, it would go fine if you got it done by someone reputable, but it's something to take into account.<br /><br />4. Yes. It's not necessarily about looking better, but about looking the way you want.________________<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v462/lemur821/toughyorp.png[/img]"

Think of something you don't respect or like, and imagine meeting someone with the logo of that tattooed around their neck - you'd immediately think less of them because of it, so it could put you at a disadvantage if it's too visible.<br /><br />Also, what happens if Scooter suddenly do something you find embarassing?  What if they get bored with their style of music and join forces with Marilyn Manson (or a Christan rock group, whichever you find worse) and suddenly your tattoo represents something quite different?  Or they could make it big as a children's entertainment group, and people would be wondering why you've got a tattoo that might as well say \"Barbie\" [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img] <br /><br />This isn't any way to try to get myself looking better or such (a tattoo wouldn't do that) as Gal said. I've seriously thought getting one for about a year or more. I'd definitely get Scooter tattoo (or something Keen, or both [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img] ). Scooter is my favourite band and I'll always love their music. I think it's pretty much a band that people either love or hate. I don't care whether they're that popular or not, I wouldn't get the tattoo because of any popularity, I'd get it because I like them. Besides, I wouldn't get anything huge tattoo, just something small.<br /><br />And yeah, perhaps placing it on the neck is a bit too visible. Too bad there are such 'dangers'. I think I could place it on the left forearm or higher.3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be.

It's as painful (some say even more) as getting a tattoo in the first place, but it's way more expensive. It's also possible that it will leave a scar behind, since tattoos involve some scarring. It sounds worse to me than just keeping the thing.

Hmm... <br /><br />I don't intend to get a tattoo (or piercings). In fact, I grew bored with colouring my hair after trying it a few times over the course of a couple of years. I figure no matter how much I make myself look different I'll still be me, so I might as well be comfortable with the fact.<br /><br />Though I do consider the possibility sometimes--there are a few things which are such a big part of my life that I would like to make some kind of statement about them (ie. Keen).<br /><br />The 'bored of it when you're thirty' argument I don't see holding up--30 is practically 21, and already my fandom of Keen has lasted 15 years. The fact that there are so many likeminded people out there indicates that won't dissipate any time soon.<br /><br />Besides, I don't consider that I have that high a pain tolerance. Having a needle jabbing into my skin for half an hour isn't my idea of fun, even for the sake of self-expression.<br /><br />I'm all for the Scooter tattoo. They are teh pwnage. However, I find a better way of getting the point across is to crank their music at full volume.<br /><br />[hr]<b>Lemur</b> Commander Keen never would have gotten off the ground without alchohol.<br />[hr]<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v192/Jimage/keenlike/XXXXToMars.jpg[/img]"
