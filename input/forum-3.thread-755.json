Now, that of Shadow Knights is very much longer than that of Dave's So I think to myself, 'If I can make the tileinfo file external, than Dave will run with as many tiles as SK...\"<br /><br />So here it is; a short level using SK tiles, i.e TWICE the number Dave usues.

Well Dave's and SK's tileinfo is identical to Keens...<br /><br />Now I'm not saying I've managed it, lets just say  I'm close. Once the tileinfo file is external. well, the tile limit is set by memory alone, usually at around 1'000 tiles, given the normal Keen graphics...<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
