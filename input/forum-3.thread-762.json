I wonder if these were rejects or if they would've been used in Keen Dreams?<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the archive also includes CAMEIN.IMF, which is that one ripped from the game that doesn't seem to be used for anything, which is curious in that the archive has a filename for it...<br /><br />[url=http://chiptunes.back2roots.org/adlib/Apogee.zip]Apogee.zip[/url] (768kB)<br /><br />The full archive is downloadable from the [url=http://chiptunes.back2roots.org]homepage[/url]."
