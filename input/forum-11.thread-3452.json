I don't have the money to pay for the new ones (I don't have 500 for the console +60xeach game + 15 for a memory card + 30 for extra controller)<br />B. I don't really like that many modern games<br />C. I've heard they are all really glitched.<br />D. I'm really pissed at Nintendo for extenting Legend of Zelda: TP for over a year and a half... Those fuclers.<br /><br /><br />Anyways, I downloaded Michel Ancel's trailer... He is so awesome.  It was so awesome.<br /><br />I've always LOVED his work (Being one of the few original game thinkers tantamount to Tom Hall, imo.), but I've never actually seen him or heard him talk.  It was good...<br /><br />So, 6 Rayman games and counting:<br /><br />Rayman<br />Rayman Gold<br />Rayman 2: The Great Escape (To date the best game)<br />Rayman: Arena<br />Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc<br />Rayman 4: Raving Rabbids<br /><br /><br />And next to Commander Keen, my favourite game series...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."
