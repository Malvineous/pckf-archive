[Since I'm too lazy to do anything else] and will broadly follow the adventures of Tzen, a vorticon who is sent to earth to retrieve the holy pogostick that was recently swiped. [No, she doesn't know why anyone wants it either]<br /><br />As yet we have no idea when it'll be uploaded, and since we don't have a ssite to put stuff on [not to mention a total lack of html skills] we're just gonna dump strips into this topic. Its most definitely going to be a lot lower quality than B&amp;S [Think newspaper comic strip meets crappy chibi styling] Here is a brief lil sketch of the main character, Tzen:<br /><br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/tsen.png[/img]<br /><br /><br />Of course this will only go ahead with community approval, what do you think?A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
