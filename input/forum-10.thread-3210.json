Previously I was unable to concentrate on reading 20 or more pages at a time, especially when I was bored, but now I've learnt to channel boredom into reading, which is very handy.<br /><br />Some time ago I finished the Chronicles of Obernewtyn by Isobelle Carmody. 'Twas quite intriguing, but had a rather weird and anticlimatic ending that leaves the story hanging and the characters kinda lost. It looks like Carmody got bored writing the fourth book and wanted to get it over and done with, but also wanted to leave it open for a possible, yet unlikely, fifth book.<br /><br />More recently I read Geomancer, the first book in Ian Irvine's The Well of Echoes--the first 600-page book I've managed to read in the space of a fortnight. It takes some serious resolve to write something this unrelentingly tragic. So many crushed hopes, broken spirits and disastrous misunderstandings, Irvine afforded his characters absolutely no mercy. Next in line is Tetrarch, which I'll be buying next time I'm in book shop that actually has it in stock.<br /><br />Currently I'm rereading Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, which I found at a book store in Melbourne when I went up to see H.I.M. I read it back in 2000 or so, followed by the Book of Atrus and later, after playing Myst, the Book of D'Ni. I hadn't played any of the games at this point, so I managed to read/play the entire series up to Myst III (and Uru) in order. I'm yet to play IV and V.<br /><br />Anybody who hasn't read/played the awesomeness that is the Myst series, must do so ASAP. KeenRush, I'm talking to you. I'm also setting my girlfriend this task once I'm finished reading the first book again.<b></b> Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <b></b><br /><br />A concerned member of the Preservation of Endangered Spleens Society<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
