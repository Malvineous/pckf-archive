		"content": "Good you like it but I think numer 1 rock album of the 80s goes a bit to far. Also most songs are not about drugs and none of them were written by Adler. The only song that's about drugs that I can think of is Mr Brownstone.<br />-----------------<br />[img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/s/jcw/img/logo_jamster_navi.gif[/img][img]http://www.jamster.co.uk/storage/view/335/0/cr/CrazyFrog___Axel_F_Falling.gif[/img]"
