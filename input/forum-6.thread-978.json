There's plenty of activity, but when something gets posted it eventually gets buried beneath everything else, and the people who don't visit very often miss out on many of the goings-on, which is then interpreted as \"lack of interest\", which produces less incentive to either create new projects or post about existing ones.<br /><br />I've been working for a few months on something that will hopefully improve this situation, but I've still got a lot to learn before it'll be useful."
