		"content": "I posted this on another forum, but I figure it's pertinent here as much as anywhere else:<br /><br />The full title of the game I'm referring to is \"Biff Proton in Killing Time\".  I've spent quite some time now looking for information on this title, but I've had no luck at all in finding any.  I discovered the game on some Polish(?) abandonware site; I'd give a link to it, but the mods would get upset and remove it anyways.  Anyhow, there was Biff Proton, shoved in right between Hovertank 3D and the Catacombs trilogy.  The only information is this chunk I ran through an online translator:<br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]Biff Proton in Killing Time is a play, which I came over here completely on accident; a acquaintence of my father gave it a number of old disks, and this play was on one of them. I have never all possible information about it found differently than, which gave few the play me. It is credited, how develops from Dark Castle Softworks, but the InterNet seems to have no information about it. Possibly is this, how the Legend of the Seven Paladins, close-release play of a small developer, that went under it?[hr][/quote]<br />As far as I can gather from this, the guy's dad got a bundle of floppy disks from a friend of his, and the kid found the game on one of them.  I looked up Dark Castle Softworks, but like the guy said, nothing.  So I'm one to jump on the boat that this was from some small developer that went belly up before it came out.  Although what really puzzles me is how this looks to be directly based off of the Hovertank 3D engine, yet nobody from Softdisk or iD seems to acknowledge the existence of this game.<br /><br />Here are a few screencaps I took:<br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/biffp_000.PNG[/img]<br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/biffp_001.PNG[/img]<br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/biffp_002.PNG[/img]<br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/biffp_003.PNG[/img]"

The joke got way out of hand, and I was trying frantically to get it done before anyone figured me out. I went so far as to make a \"Dark Castle Softworks\" logo to replace my personal logo on the game. No, actually. The joke went too far when I grudgingly registered a Polish webhost in case somebody ever demanded to see the website. Still, the game is still in production and should hopefully be out in the near future. I hope nobody's upset that this isn't really a lost piece of history, and that any and all interested parties will still have a look when this officially comes out."
