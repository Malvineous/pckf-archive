I'm pretty sure the C in the name stands for \"cracked\" as the monster name check has been removed from that version.<br /><br />Anyways, I thought some of the board visitors here have the CGA version of Keen 6, but why doesn't anyone make a patch? Also how did you originally purchase the CGA version? I thought only the EGA one appeared on the store shelves, right?"

The one who found it says that it is <b>the EGA</b>, yes <b>EGA</b> version of the game, and there is another crack than the well known TSR that replaces the exe. It has some bytes modified so that instead of the new game section taking you into the document check, it takes you straight into the game.<br /><br />So in conclusion <b>this is the cracked version of Keen 6 EGA!</b>"
