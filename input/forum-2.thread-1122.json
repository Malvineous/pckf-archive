		"content": "Well, I feel the need to announce it. I have been working on a Keen1 mod last month. It's titled \"Commander Keen The Return of the Shikadi, Episode One: 'Lost in the Shadows'\". It takes place after \"the Universe is Toast\". I wrote a storytxt.ck1 with the story, but I think it needs improvement. One of my goals with this mod is to give the perspective illusion with tiles (like Keen4).<br /><br />I'll upload a screenshot of the title screen soon. The story is very simple.<br /><br />---<br /><br />After the defeat of Mortimer McMire, nothing special has happened, and the Universe seems to be in peace again. However, one day, when Commander Keen was listening to a sitcom with the Photacyion Transceiver, a strange transmission is heard. It was a message of the Shikadi, who plan to take over the Milky Way! They're led by someone called the \"shadow master\". They say their first objective is to kill Keen. Billy jumps into the BWB Megarocket and heads to Gnosticus IV.<br /><br />With the help of the Oracle, Commander Keen learns who's his enemy, although very little information is known about him. He travels to the Shikadi's secret base on Umbria V, where the Omega Force Shikadi joined the Alpha Force Shikadi under the command of the Shadow Master.<br /><br />However, when reaching Umbria V, the BWB Megarocket is attacked and gets serious damage. After an emergency landing, Keen begins his adventure in Umbria V, to find 4 magic crystals the Shadow Master hid in different places of Umbria V. If Keen collects the 4 crystals, he'll be able to defeat this new enemy.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I think I need some suggestions about the Commander Keen sprite. The height of the sprite is limited to the original Keen sprite of the Vorticons trilogy (because changing the size could cause some problems with tiles and Keen's movements), and I'd like a Keen4-looking sprite. I might also have problems with the Shikadi sprites (they replace the Gargs).<br /><br />Here is a screenshot of the title screen:<br />[img]http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/3769/modtitlejq7.png[/img]<br /><br />I expect this to be finished next year, but since it depends on my spare time, I can't promise anything. Also note that I'm online only once or twice a week.<br /><br />EDIT: The vorticons are replaced by the Shadow Master. I have some ideas about it, but I won't be sure until I start making the levels.<br /><br />[hr]<br />\"<i>Eat your veggies!</i>\""

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopekeen.gif[/img]  <br /><br />But the background artifacts, the statue with blue glowing eyes, and the gray floor tiles were all drawn by me, with some inspiration (specially the statue). [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  The blue laser field was also drawn from scratch. I haven't tested it in action, but I *think* it should look pretty good when animated.<br /><br />Yeah, the lollypop wasn't my best idea, and I'll probably replace it later. The donut was ripped from Keen4, but I'll try to draw one myself and add some candy to it. The blue pack thing at the left is supposed to be a pack of marsh-mellows. I hope it looks like it is.<br /><br />The brown yorp is a chocolate yorp. You guess where I got the idea from. (Hint: I consider it the best Keen fangame ever made for DOS.)<br /><br />The framed picture of the Shadow Master, well, it should be like the Grand Intellect picture we saw in Keen3. I drew it, converted it and reduced its colors all by myself. (It was the result of a very, very, very boring afternoon; I have adapted it to be my avatar, user account picture, and part of my mod's tileset.)<br /><br />BTW, the mod's codename is \"SHIKADI1\". It's the name of its folder and batch file, actually.<br />[hr][img]http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/983/vegetableswk2.gif[/img]"

The pogo is green, supposedly an enhanced version of the one he found on Mars. Additionally, he has a blue, enhanced, neural stunner (although in episodes 3 and 5 he'll use different weapons).<br /><br />Keen GBC authors should be happy now [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] ------------------<br /><b>SM:</b> <i>\"I could go and write a page about the Theory of Relativity (or whatever it's called), but, what is the point if I don't know what the Theory of Relativity is?\"</i><br /><br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]"

I replaced 30% of the tiles (15% of them ripped from other games/mods) with my new, own tiles which look pretty cool. I'll leave the criticism for the betatesters though.<br /><br />I got the idea, Flaose. Excellent, did you know that the Vorticon death animation has so many frames that I was using less than 50% of them? Your idea is great, I can now use all that empty space.
