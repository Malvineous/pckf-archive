Cartoony, like Keen Dreams<br />2. 2.5D shading, like Issis II, but non-isometric<br />3. Neo-Cartoony, like Flash animations<br />3. 2.5D, along with isometric view<br />4. Neo-Cartoony, isometric<br />5. Other<br /><br />So, what are your opinions?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

Isometric work always feels somewhat constrained and lego-like."

I know that's not actually feasible since it would require a cel shading engine, which obviously would never appear in a fangame, we have a hard enough time getting the basics of the engine running[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopefish.gif[/img]  (no offense to devs, you all do great work[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  ) . Not to mention that the amount of time that would have to go into the actual models would be quite large[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dopefish.gif[/img] , I'm just saying it would be pretty darn cool.<br /><br />Beyond that, I'd say neo-cartoony with the tradition keen perspective. That style seems like it would really suit Keen, he was always kind of a cartoon character, though I wouldn't want it to go into outrageously big heads or any bizarreness like that.---------<br />www.eternalwanderer.com"
