		"content": "Last night, I started messing around with Fruityloops again, out of sheer boredom.  (Which will probably get me back to work on Dangerous Dave vs. The Infernal Infantry-- finally!)  I realized then that I had the IMF scores for several games lying around.  Without second thought, I ripped the score of The Armageddon Machine, which had been going through my head a lot lately, and kicked it up a notch with some rockin' instruments.  Here's the result!<br /><br />[url=http://www.zxdware.net/The%20Armageddon%20Machine%20-Orchestrated-.mp3]The Armageddon Machine -Orchestrated-[/url]<br /><br />I also did Monster Bash's Bach Bash and Demons, as well as Spear of Destiny's \"Tiptoeing Around,\" although the SOD one sounds a bit awkward.  I think it's due to overall strangeness in the musical design, though, so whatever.  If anyone's interested, I'll throw both Bach Bash and Demons up.<br /><br />Oh, and what do you guys think?"

I even wrote lyrics for it!  So that's also an option now, if anyone wants to hear."

		"content": "Alright, finally got a chance to download this.  It's pretty nice, but here's some constructive criticism.<br /><br />The initial descending bassline is only interesting the first time the listener is exposed to it--after that, it's nothing but ostinato so that the rest of the song can develop around it.  As such, after its initial exposition, (i.e. the first 4 measures,) it should either change instruments, or become considerably less echo-y than it is.  I could barely make out the harp when it came in! <br /><br />The pulsing chords instrument didn't really do much for me; it sounded arbitrary and not really meshed with the rest of the setup you had.  Because it's such a static, rhythmic part, it's a perfect opportunity to experiment with different filters, fade effects, and volume changes--in the original, I believe it started almost inaudible and only gradually got louder.  There's a lot of potential there--even if you decided to keep the current instrument.<br /><br />The measure where the song strikes a major C chord instead of the minor it's been in up until that point, I'd add some sort of soft cymbal crash, or somehow announce that point--I'm not sure what Bobby Prince had in mind when he wrote it originally, but to me it absolutely cements an air of mystery into the piece... and to have it sneak by unceremoniously and unannounced just doesn't do the work justice.<br /><br />Finally, when the entire piece shifts gears into the more classical, Masterpiece Theatre-esque part, I feel like you completely missed the point.  In the game when this piece was originally used, it shifted to this brighter style as it announced Keen's mission, and gave the entire game an anticipatory, eager air.  Your version sounds like it's simply going through the motions and is rather uninspired.<br /><br />I like what you've done with it so far, but I think you could do a lot more.  :-)  And share those Monster Bash MIDIs!!<br /><br />[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"
