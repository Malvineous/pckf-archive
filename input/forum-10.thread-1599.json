I did a while ago...<br /><br />Mind you I don't like spending 10.00 USD to see a movie... but I liked spending 10.00 USD to see Grindhouse. I thought it's over the top cheesy-ness was amazing. <br /><br />Grind house is pretty much 2 movies put together. The film is like that of a B-grade movie of the 60's or 70's. The first movie was \"Planet Terror\" which was making fun of horrid zombie movies. That had me laughing my ass off the whole time I was sitting there. <br /><br />The second movie was \"Death Proof\" and was not AS good as Planet Terror but still was really neat. It was a movie about an old stunt driver who had a \"death proof\" car in which he would try and kill people with. It has WAY too much completely pointless talking though.<br /><br />What do you all think?-----------------------<br />The end of this post. You may stop reading now."

Plus, Quentin Tarantino is from Knoxville (where I live) and throws Knoxville references into his movies, which is pretty neat (in Death Proof, the reference was the News Sentinel newspaper, which is K-town's main paper even though the movie was in Lebanon).<br /><br />The previews were wonderful too.

I DON'T CARE about who some New Zealand or African-American chick was fucking last month or who they have a crush on.<br /><br />And seriously... that was most of the movie.

I mean, I've seen and enjoyed a lot of movies with over-the-top violence, but this is the first movie ever to make me feel literally nautious.  That part where the girl was about to get raped and you-know-what happens... I was this close to puking right there in the theatre.<br /><br />The \"Death Proof\" part I liked a lot more, but it could have done for some editing.<br /><br />The part that I loved though was the Thanksgiving horror movie trailer.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  I was streaming tears I was laughing so hard.  That alone almost made the first half worth it.<br /><br />Anyway, a rollercoaster of emotions if nothing else."
