But if you want a custom but you will provide your own.  A good bot is an eggdrop.<br />[url=http://www.eggheads.org/]www.eggheads.org/[/url]<br />and a good support site, and script site for your bot is at:<br />[url=http://www.egghelp.org/]www.egghelp.org/[/url]<br /><br />Both these run on *nix operating systems only i beleve.  I use eggdrop for  games on some of the channels im on at rizon."
