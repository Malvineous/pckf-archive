		"content": "Well, I finally started working on my first mod!<br />Well, almost didn't draw a thing. Currently it was only color changing and copying images from other Keen games, and other stuff.<br /><br />The mod is called:<br />Commander Keen in: Planet of Ice<br />or<br />Commander Keen - Episode 1 &amp; a Half: Planet of Ice<br /><br />The \"1 &amp; a Half\" has a meaning:<br />It's like what happened in the middle between episode one and two.<br /><br />The story:<br />The Vorticons ultramagnetize Keen's ship and make Keen land on the distant Planet of Ice, that is known to have a terrible shortage of fuel and other important materials. While Keen takes a look around, he notices a couple of Vorticons doing something near his ship. Keen hurries to catch them, but they manage to escape. The Vorticons stole Keen's fuel for needs of the Vorticons' hidden base in the Planet of Ice. The Vorticons splitted the fuel to a number of power sources. They put each one near every city, and it gives energy to the whole city. Keen has to go through every city and get the fuel back to the ship and blast away!<br /><br />Not that great, but I hope that somebody will like my mod.Couldn't he just use the pogo!?"

Check out what Xtraverse did to the old Yorps and Gargs in his early mods--he made just their eyes and feet wander around!  KeenRush gave the Yorps teeth in his first mod, Yorphius II.  Try doing little changes, and maybe you can work up from there."
