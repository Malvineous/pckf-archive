For example:<br />[url=http://spatang.com/ck][img]http://spatang.com/ck/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url]<br /><br /><b>Update 2007-10-22</b><br />Two new buttons have been added. The Keen Wiki (Malvineous) and Keen: The Strip (Mort01). Woot.<br /><br />You can observe them at [url=http://www.planetkeen.com/]Planet Keen[/url], the Keen news site.<br /><br /><b>A partial list:</b><br />Keen:Modding<br />Blegd and Smeeg<br />CC314<br />[url=http://www.keengrid.net/tgmm/]The Garg's Mod Maze[/url] (defunct? Alas...)<br /><br /><b>DONE:</b><br />PCKF<br />Keen Wiki<br />[url=http://keencomic.blogspot.com/]Commander Keen: the comic strip[/url]<br /><br />(Thanks go to Malvineous and Mort01 for their contributions)<br /><br />There are obviously others, so feel free to add to the list and/or create a corresponding link image.<br /><br />Post your work here, or email it to jimage at gmail mentioning 'keen' in the subject. I'll be adhering to a certain level of quality, but please at least give it a shot, even if it's something simple that may be used as a place-holder until something shinier appears.<br /><br />PNG, GIF or zipped BMP is preferred, as these are lossless formats guaranteed to keep all the pixels in tact.<br /><br />Any that I have within 48 hours will be used immediately. After that I'm disappearing for two weeks, and I'd like to get this project up and running before I leave."
