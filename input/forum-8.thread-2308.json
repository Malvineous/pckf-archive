It picked up the drive as 12Gb or something.<br /><br />It's dependent on the BIOS. You may be able to flash it to a later version, but I doubt you'll get anything higher than 20Gb or so running on a Pentium Classic.<br /><br />The filesystem type doesn't come into play until the computer has booted past the BIOS. It's possible (and indeed preferable) to install DOS on a FAT32 partition, so I'd say ~125Gb would be a practical maximum for any partition... you should be able to get something like a 250 running as two separate partitions and still run in DOS, if you were so inclined, but don't quote me on that.<br /><br />I suggest you simply experiment. Test the machine with a sequence of drives of increasing size, and note when it stops detecting the full volume. There you'll find your limit.<br /><br />I also suggest using FreeDOS over MS-DOS. One advantage is its much-improved and speedier fdisk utility."

		"content": "The FAT32 limit is actually 2TB (2048GB) so that won't be a problem, but using FAT16 the largest partition you can have is 2GB - so you'd need almost 40 partitions to use the full 80GB (assuming your BIOS can see the full 80GB), and with only 24 drive letters available (C: through Z:) you're not gonna get anywhere close <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />Seagate also have a drive overlay which will take over from where the BIOS left off and give you full access to the drive's capacity, but again, with FAT16 you'll run out of drive letters before you reach full capacity.  Your only option is probably to run the version of DOS that came with Win9x, and use FAT32 (or if FreeDOS supports FAT32, then that.)  I run DOS 7.1 on my DOS machines (which came with Win98) and have never had a problem - although the largest disk I've ever put in those machines is 3.2GB, you'd have to have rather a lot of DOS games to fill up anything near 80GB...<br /><br />Oh, and Windows 95 and on have this \"drive overlay\" built into them, which is why they can see the full capacity of the disk without any extra software."
