Sounds too difficult to keep together.\"Out of curiosity, what is that score in the Earth measurement system?\" The official searched through his papers momentarily.<br />\"...That would be three hundred fifteen.\"<br />\"Three hundred fifteen... This person must be the most intelligent being throughout the entire Universe.\" No one in the room had any immediate comment."
