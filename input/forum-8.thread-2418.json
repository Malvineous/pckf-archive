I was up to 5th place (now 7th) on the leaderboard (out of about 100,000 people).  I made a video of the game I got the highscore, if anybody's interested.

I eventually wrote a little tool that would handle all the file modifying for me.  That was before the ckxpatch utilities, which I think are really nice.  But I did actually make a little level before that \"first level\" using only a hex editor, when I was figuring out how the level data was stored in the file.  It was a silly small thing that only used the \"block\" tiles, but it worked!"
