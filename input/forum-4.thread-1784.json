One can never tell what to expect from a game made with something like Multimedia Fusion, but I think that this is pretty neat.  The characters and levels so far are very interesting, and the gameplay is quite nice, with pogoing, ledge-grabbing, moving platforms, etc.  I ran out of lives on level 2, though...I shall try again and see if I can get further.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dexter.gif[/img]  [hr][/quote]<br />Using some kind of tiling system and the array object, level editing becomes easier, accessible for non-MMF users, your game becomes expandable, and the biggest advantage is that you will only ever need one frame that loads the correct level file - which means that if you change an event, you don't have to go through all the frames changing all of them.<br /><br />I didn't feel like pointing out some things I encountered last night, so here I go:<br /><br />Not being able to save and load is REALLY lacking this game. Sure, you get a password every once in a while, but that's just... so un-Keenish! It's not difficult to make a save file - just store the lives, score etcetera in an INI when pressing a function key.<br /><br />Not being able to see the stats without pressing a key is not handy. Try to do like they did in the original games - some basic stats where you have the level name right now. Those stats are more important than a level name, so make those show up by default. In fact, there's plenty of space to leave the level name below it or something.<br /><br />Menus are useful, and they just really feel neglected in this game. Select an option and you get a red screen full of text - could use polish. The sound test also does absolutely nothing. If you make a menu, make sure it's either compact or fully functional and polished. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]   Also, the Quit option is selected by default, you might wanna change that.<br /><br />Movement is a bit sloppy in some cases. For example, collision around climbable borders gives some problems occasionally, like Keen getting a jump boost or still moving a bit while hanging onto the ledge. Jumping is fixed height, while variable height jumping could make for some nice level designs. Oh, I just remembered, slope walking works like crap, you need to fix that. Use a fastloop to push him down a few pixels if some bottom detector is overlapping the ground, but Keen isn't, for example. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]  <br />More movement system problems: rapid shooting when jumping and shooting down, being able to shoot while pogo-ing and NOT stopping to pogo, small animation problems when walking against irregular walls or doing stuff while jumping/pogoing.<br /><br />The level design isn't all that bad most of the time, though you could have spent some more time on improving it. Not being able to defeat the slugs is weird, and they're really in the way in some levels, so... In one of the temple levels you also have to wait for platforms way too much, and there are a few blind jumps.<br /><br />Pogo is acting weird - it's either a low jump or a high jump. Not variable once again, but it doesn't matter as much with the pogo I guess.<br /><br />You disabled some default keys, like reconfiguring the key settings or pausing the game. I'd leave those in if I were you, even if they're mostly hotkeys only known by Clickers. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]  <br /><br />There was no way to quit, other than die or press alt+F4. In relation to the pausing thing, you might want to pause the game and pop up a menu when pressing escape.<br /><br />I think there are extensions available to access the alt key, like the Control X object or the Alt key object. Use this to be able to map pogo-ing to the alt key. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Platforms have issues, like not being able to jump or pogo correctly on them. If you fall, there is also no limit on how fast you can fall, so if you fall TOO fast you fall through some objects (can be remedied by using fastloops to move Keen - it'll never skip a single inbetween pixel while falling!).<br /><br />The enemies shared some values regulary. For example, if you stand on a mad mushroom in level 2, ALL mushrooms get mad, not just that one. Make sure to make all instances of an enemy unique by spreading a value so you can make sure only that enemy will do things like this!<br /><br />While typing in here, I lost all of my bullets and I keep pogo-ing when I return to the game. The game takes input while not being focused - fix?<br /><br />Looking up and down results in Keen barely being visible anymore, you might want to lower the amount of how much Keen can look up or down.<br /><br />Keen has this brown star on his helmet, not a G. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Just a question - did you have any one beta test the game before you released it? If not, at least half of the things I said might have been fixed before first release if you had someone test it. Probably. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]  <br /><br />EDIT: btw, the music is a tad simple (no counter melody and not much instruments supporting the background of the song), and there are some regular mistakes in the remixes (like the forest song having a few notes that go half a note too low).____________<br />Don't see me as an ordinary man.<br />Even though I am an ordinary man.<br /><br />Ah, [url=http://DaVince.sitesled.com/]site.[/url]<br />Oh, and [url=http://www.tengusoft.net/]Team[/url]."

You could try the help screen like Keen 4/5/6 have, which brings you to a sub menu with more help options, story etcetera. There's also graphics and borders in that version. This also makes the main menu smaller as help, story and credits are all within the same sub menu.<br /><br />For the music test screen, you could use the same thing: the help border.<br /><br />You don't NEED and extra password frame.

		"content": "Great game, dude! <br /><br />Except the Background images, you could have made a better job there, and it was fantastic when the song to lvl 1 and 2 started to loop on lvl 3 at the same time as the 'new' song, so I couldn't hear anything.<br />It would also be nice with a saving function, it's kind of frustrating to start from the beginning over and over...<br />Or that I can get a password after Each level.<br /><br />Duhh, except that. Really great game. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]"
