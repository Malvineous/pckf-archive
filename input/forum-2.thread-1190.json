[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img] <br /><br />Right now, I've become obsessed with an online roleplaying game.  And when I'm not playing with that, I'm doing a little Keen4 mod featuring everybody's favorite gunslinging redneck, Dangerous Dave, doing what he does best.  Blowing the undead away with a shotgun.<br /><br />The plot isn't completely developed yet, but what I'm trying to go for is a spoof of Army of Darkness.  (Am I the only person who is reminded of Ash by Dave?)  It'll get sort of dark, but at the same time retain the Dave/Keen era goofy sense of humor.<br /><br />Graphics, well, sprites and backgrouns at least, will probably for the most part be borrowed.  Then again, the whole reason I started with this mod is to demonstrate something so absolutely secret and awesome that I can't divulge it until I make some sort of official release to show it.  You'll see.<br /><br />TO WHET THE APPETITE, HERE ARE A FEW SCREENSHOTS:<br /><br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/ddvii.png[/img]<br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/ddvii2.png[/img]<br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/ddvii3.png[/img]<br />[img]http://www.zxdware.net/ddvii4.png[/img]<br /><br />Also, I'm open to ideas for enemy replacements.  I only have a few ideas myself.  Just now, I had another one.  Here's what I've got so far.<br /><br />Slug -&gt; Torso Zombie, occasionally stops and leaves a pool of BIOHAZARDOUS ZOMBIE BLOOD.<br />Mimrock -&gt; Evil Hand, lies in wait and then pounces on you.<br />Berkeloid -&gt; Evil Dave, the most dangerous of foes-- yourself!<br /><br />Just had another idea!<br /><br />Wormouth -&gt; Tunnel Skeleton, digs around underground until it reaches you, then tries to grab your leg and pull you down!<br /><br /><br />That's all for now.  So I'll take questions, comments and any input AS OF NOW."

I'll work on enemy design in the meantime.  But can somebody, anybody, please help me here?  K-Sprite is really tricky."

Open K-Sprite and look at your hitboxes... open 4SPRITES.TXT and make changes based on what you see.  Save the TXT, close K-Sprite, and run a test in your mod... when you're done, do the whole set-up process again.  Each time you run set-up, it'll load your re-defined collision boxes so you can see if you got the desired effect or not.<br /><br />The truly tricky stuff comes when you start playing with Offset X and Y... I'm still not quite sure how those work.  I've been working on background tiles to try and gather my thoughts.  ;-)"

The last time I even looked at it was several months ago, and then I had some problems with x and y offsets which I can't figure out how to resolve.  This is all very difficult, and very disheartening.  I honestly wish I could continue, but it's really looking like that's just not going to happen.  To all who thought this looked good and wanted to see it, I'm deeply sorry.  I actually feel like I'm going to cry as I'm writing this, so don't think I'm a heartless jerk.<br /><br />The good news, however, is that I may resume work on The Ian Burton Adventure, should my memory indeed be serving me right in that there were no such problems existing with the game.  We'll just have to wait and see.  Hopefully things will work out.  Until then, courage.<br /><br />Also, I will release what is done should anybody be interested in it.  (However, I am not liable for any projectile vomit connected to witnessing it.)"
