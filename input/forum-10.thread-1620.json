But here is my evaluation:<br /><br />Bobaflex, Dry Kill Logic, Dillinger Escape Plan - The first three bands.  These guys really blew.  Bobaflex did this thing at the end where the singer acted like he was crying and jacking off and then pretended to shoot himself for the finale.  Please.  Suicide is so nineties.<br /><br />Symphony X - Okay.  I love this band, but they were really agressive and loud, when they are not actually an agressive and loud band.<br /><br />Fear Factory - Great, these guys were extremely loud and distorted too, but they do it so well that it was quite fun.<br /><br />Nevermore - Pretty good heavy and skilled band.  Not much more to say about them, but I was impressed.<br /><br />Dreeam Theater - Obviously the best band there.  This was worth the ticket price alone.  They opened with The Glass Prison, then went into Under A Glass Moon.  They played other sweet tunes and then closed with Pull Me Under.  They played their louder songs, but they were really really good.<br /><br />Megadeth - There were lots of couples in their thirties reliving their childhood during this band.  They were pretty good, but they don't have much variety, and I wouldn't have minded if they played a half hour instead of an hour and a half.<br /><br />Well, I don't know if anyone cares about anything I just said.  But if you get a chance, definately go to this tour.  Just show up an hour late.  XTraverse, I hope to hear what you think to.*** ---   I Am Keen is hell bent for leather.  Are you?   --- ***"

		"content": "Overall, a pretty awesome concert.  Here's the lineup:<br /><br />Bobaflex - I got into the arena too late to see any of them, apparently the venue decided to start them playing right when the doors opened and after I waited in line to get in, I was told my ticket had been changed, I had to go somewhere else to get the new one, and then come back and wait in line again.<br /><br />Nevermore - fun for a song or two but got old real fast<br /><br />Dry Kill Logic - terrible<br /><br />Dillinger Escape Plan - terrible, but every so often did some neat jazz breakdowns.  They should fire their singer and stop playing metal and then they'd possibly be tolerable :P<br /><br />Symphony X - agree completely, they were awesome but harder then they should have been. Unfortunately, their sound went out about 20-25 minutes and we got a lovely taste of Fear Factory sound checks.  The drummer did some nice solos while they were waiting for the techs to fix whatever went wrong but eventually the techs gave up or their set time was over or something.<br /><br />Fear Factory - fun metal, but like Nevermore, they weren't that interesting.  I would've rather had Symphony X on first stage and get 45 minutes.<br /><br />Life of Agony - name of the band says it all<br /><br />Dream Theater - by far the best band, they put on one hell of a show.  Portnoy was amazing as usual, and even nailing of of his drumstick tricks and tosses.  At one point he was tossing sticks on and off stage with the singer of SX.  They opened with Glass Prison which was awesome and pounded through an almost perfect metal set, ending with a Pull Me Under / Metropolis medley.<br /><br />Megadeth - I'd never actually heard this band before, and with a lot of the bands that Mustaine had picked to tour with him, I wasn't expecting much.  Megadeth surprised me though, while they are nothing compared to Dream Theater, I found myself enjoying almost all of their songs and not finding it tedious like Nevermore or Fear Factory.  The sound was a little muddied though, the vocals were getting swamped by all the other sound which did not happen at all in DT's set.  Their special effects were impressive too, with the pyro and fireworks every few songs.  Overall a great show.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this tour, if only for SX, DT, and Megadeth.  And if you get sick of Megadeth, go outside and hang around DT's tour bus, they usually come out about halfway the Megadeth's set.[url=http://spatang.com/ck][img]http://spatang.com/ck/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [url=http://spatang.com/cosmo][img]http://spatang.com/cosmo/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [url=http://spatang.com/nukem][img]http://www.spatang.com/nukem/bannersm.jpg[/img][/url] [img]http://spatang.com/scrobblersig.php[/img]"
