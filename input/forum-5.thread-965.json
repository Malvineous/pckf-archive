(I used small images as there are so many enemy types.) and it has come to my attention that several enemies are featured in both GBC and Keen 6 (Or even 4) The question is, how should the description of these enemies, (Which can be very different from the 'cannon' behaviours.) be done?<br /><br />Should they have their own seperate articles, such as 'Shikadi' and 'Shikadi GBC'? Keeping them totally seperate from the Keen 4-6 descriptions and reachable only from the Keen GBC page,<br /><br />Should they be added to the existing articles. (E.g. 'In Keen GBC Flect have reflecting plates on their chest instead...')<br /><br />Should they simply be ignored and not written about?<br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Cute bunny!"
