It'll be third-person, not a sidescroller.  As for modeling, I'll welcome anybody who can help me model all of the enemies.  But show the stuff here before e-mailing it to me.  <br /><br />My progress so far:  The only model I have done right now is Keen in his PJs, and today I'm going to start designing the 3D land of Tuberia.  I have a schedule for this game, and I'll probably spend 5-6 days on each level, which means it'll be done in the near future.<br /><br />As for finishing it before the Keen4 3D team, that's just because I'm a more efficient guy than they are.

I got Tentacles Ate My Babysitter and Goodbye Monkey Island completed in under three months each, didn't I?<br /><br />allstories, sorry if you didn't like Keen Dreams.  I chose it for my first 3D Keen game because of one reason:  it's the easiest to program (lack of pogo stick will ease production a lot).  I'm no C-Script wiz, but I know enough to have Keen locked out of the final level until he collects 15 Boobus Bombs!  Despite this, play control will be exactly like the original game.<br /><br />As for the levels, they'll retain their basic structure from the original games, but be much more wide open.  For instance, remember that road-walkway thingy Keen walks along in the first level (Horseradish Hill)?  In the 3D game, it'll we wide enough for lots of freedom of movement, and yet confined to a path (that's just the same formula as Crash Bandicoot, and it worked, didn't it?  The only thing different from CB with this game will be the ability to turn the camera)<br /><br />However, don't expect this to be the most detailed game in the world.  I'm going for a very simple style with solid colors, to try to keep that \"cartoon\" feel of the original game (it looks alot like Kirby 64, which ironically was also heavily influenced by Crash Bandicoot!)<br /><br />And finally, I am going to do Keen 1-3 in 3D after this if this is a success (by then I'll be able to program a pogo stick).<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]You can also just create new levels which look like the old ones.

Sorry for the long absence from these forums - I've been really busy lately with school and real-life stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, Keen Dreams 3D progress is coming along OK.  Things are getting finished, slowly but surely.  My hard drive stopped working back in January, but luckily, I told the guy at Radio Shack what to save before wiping it out and KD3D got saved.  However, I still need somebody to help me out with the C-scripting.  I solved the pole problem, but I still need help on instant death collisions and how to make Keen shoot seeds.  I'm hoping the game'll be finished soon, but don't keep your fingers crossed, because I still have a lot to do.<br /><br />Also Djaser, what second project are you referring to?  If you mean the continuation of my series where Holiday Hijinx! was the first part, everyone who didn't like the engine will be comforted to know that I'm switching studios, but I don't want to say anything else for now, as I'm still working with it."

Even though the original Dreams had only 16 colors and for the levels they used even less, that doesn't mean you have to make your game look like EGA too. The dark sky does look more nightmareish but it's color should be less purple and more blue, and there are too many cloud's edges visible which makes it a bit weird. Maybe that's why others don't like it?  The light one is good too, but it needs more tones.<br /><br />Even if you change nothing, this is a promising project and I'm looking forward to what you make out of it. I'm a bit curious about what the gameplay will be like?"
