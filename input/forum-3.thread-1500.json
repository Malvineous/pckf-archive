Well I thought it would be cool to set up one for Keeners.<br /><br />[url=http://www.frappr.com/keeners]Check it out.[/url]<br /><br />Come on, be a sport and put yourself down. It is free, quick and relatively painless. I already put myself down. Just click on my little marker on the map.<br /><br />And could someone give an invitation to the people over at Keen:Modding? I never signed up there and I don't feel like doing it just to tell them about this.-----------------------<br />[img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/shikadimastercopy.gif[/img]"
