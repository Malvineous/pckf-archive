These are the stumbling blocks I cant get past at the moment.<br /><br />1. I changed the title image, to 320*200. But the animations of the creeping plant, the fire etc, show through. <br /><br />2. I have analyzed the extracted contents of various mods, and their tileset has been rearranged. How do you do this ?<br /><br />3. Following on from the above question, what method do other modders use to draw the worldmap. It seems near impossible in the original tileset bmp, as its a scrawl of diagonal pieces.<br /><br />4.How do you create 2 or 4 frame animated point items, and random background animations.<br /><br /><br />Thank you."

What a waste of effort.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-furious.gif[/img] <br /><br />For question 1, edit level90.ck1. You'll probably want to use the patch for positioning the title bitmap at the very top-left of the screen, too.<br /><br />For drawing complicated groups of tiles, I usually create a separate bitmap to create complete images, then carve out the individual tiles and paste them into the tileset however they fit.<br /><br />In reply to 2 and 4, essentially my reply was \"use Tileinfo\", as Grafix says. There are certain tiles (ie. the DONE squares and bridge tile). Also, tile 143 is the background tile that collectable items turn into when Keen grabs them, but there is a patch that can mae them turn into the first tile in their row in the tileset.<br /><br />I'm not sure what you mean by random background animations, but you can animate any combination of 2 or 4 tiles including point items.<br /><br />If in doubt about anything, Keen:Modding is your best bet. Just ask and we'll help you out with whatever you're having trouble with.<br /><br />Welcome to the forums, and to the neat world of Keen modding.\""

Secondly What is the process for creating a new Map. Moving levels. and making them link in Keen Editor.<br /><br />3. Can you change the ending sequence (the bwb flying), or just the two frames of the lights in Billys house coming on and off.<br /><br />4.
