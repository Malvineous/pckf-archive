I'd like to take a break from existing for a while, but alas it is not a possibility.<br /><br />There's a huge void in my life that I've long distracted myself from though my so-called dreams and aspirations. However, because of these very things my relationship is toast, and I'm becoming more and more recluse. I need to bring myself back into the moment.<br /><br />I don't know what the next step is, but I've got a lot to sort out in my head. If I keep working on Keen stuff, or in fact anything to do with computers, I'll just be distracting myself for a while and it'll all collapse again, but worse.<br /><br />My mods and editing tools are thus cancelled until further notice, and I shall be AFK (though I may follow this thread for a short time).<br /><br />I will return, but I can't say when. If you need to contact me for any reason, use the email address in my profile or catch me on MSN, which I'll leave signed in when I can.<br /><br />jiofe' and Keen On."

I just drifted away when things other than Keen took my focus. But now I'm back, mainly for the community rather than to get into more Keen projects (apart from Strifetoons, hehe).

DUH! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img]   That is why I still hang out on these forums! (joke)<br /><br />And finally, what do I do in problematic situations? Naturally depends on situation, but if it's some human stuff (as partly or entirely in this case, I gather, as you mentioned something about a relationship), I don't have any other experience than just waiting till something good happens or alternatively losing a buddy..
