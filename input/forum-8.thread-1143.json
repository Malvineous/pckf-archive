If they play too fast, rename them to .wlf (instead of .imf) and if they play too slowly rename them to .imf.  This makes it possible to play every single IMF file I'm aware of at the correct speed *except* Duke Nukem II, but those IMFs are supported by the AdPlug database so they should play fine (if not I've got tweaked versions that run at proper IMF speed.)<br /><br />In case you're wondering what the correct speed is, here's a short list:<br /><br />.IMF: Bio Menace, Cosmo, Keen, Major Stryker, Monster Bash<br />.WLF: Anything based on the Wolf3D engine (Blake Stone, Body Count, etc.)"
