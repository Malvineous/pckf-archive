		"content": "And, as nifty and useful as it is, decided to take a look at my old Keen drawings that some of you might remember from a few years ago. Not as nice looking now as they seemed back then, in retrospect. As it turns out, the old monitor apparently had really, really bad contrast. So I take a look at the CK4 title screen remake, only to be horrified by the knowledge that most of the outlines were this hideous brown, which had appeared as black on the old hardware. Why the heck no one bothered pointing this out in the first place is beyond me, since it ruined the picture.<br /><br />So, two years after the fact, [img]http://img445.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ck4title7ou.png[/img], in the odd event that any of you actually care. The old version is still up [url=http://dosclassics.com/keen/art.php]here[/url] at BtP, for comparison.<br /><br />And since it's semi-related and not immediately repulsive, I'll go ahead and repost [img]http://img445.imageshack.us/my.php?image=lazyday7vi.png[/img] for the heck of it.<br /><br />And if anyone is interested, I drew the CK6 title screen up at around the same time, but never did anything with it. If there's any demand for a finished version, I'd be willing to give it a go."
