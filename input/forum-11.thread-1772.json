I haven't touched it in a while, and I just had some guy email me with some game stuff he's managed to decrypt, and it'd be a shame for that to go to waste.  Is there anyone who'd like to team up with me, so that we can design and code a good, stable, proper game extractor tool that's open source and so forth?<br /><br />I remember someone saying they wanted to make one, no idea who it was though.----------------------<br />Support (at least partially) for 27 games!<br />Check out the progress of Wombat Game Tools [url=http://student.ci.qut.edu.au/~n4738667/index.php?section=wombatwip]here[/url]"

		"content": "OK guys - despite being very en-inbriated (I hate making these sort of posts, sorry in advance) - I have one thing to say.  Yes.<br /><br />I don't need someone to work out game formats.  I really don't care about that.  I need someone to work with, as this lone wolf sh*t is getting old.  All I need is someone to work with to figure out the best way to make a game extractor/replace thing, to throw ideas around with as to how to best write a proggie that can handle images/sound/etc - even if you want to do something unrelated to games.  You want to do the plugin core?  Go for it.  You want to only take care of music playback/extracting?  Sure.  I just don't want to take the whole f*cking thing on, as the thousands of lines of code is too much for one peep.  Even if you just want to design it, that's fine with me.  All I ask is that someone takes some of the load off my back, as it's too big an ask for one person.<br /><br />I know that some people have managed to make this sort of deal by themselves, but I simply don't want to.  Call me weak, but when I do this sort of sh*t I put my whole heart into it, and end up snowed under.  You want a game tool like this? In that case, let's put our people force together and make it happen.  Seriously, I've written programs that get to 40,000 lines of code and it is not possible to manage it all by myself, and Wombat is slowly getting close.  I want to open source this thing, but that requires a re-write and I'm not willing to do that on my own.<br /><br />I know you guys appreciate what I put in - but I'm really full up and don't have the time or energy to put in 100% all by my ittty bitty self.<br /><br />Peace out - szev.<br /><br />-- If no-one's up for it, I'll put up a link to the mess that Wombat is currently in, hopefully someone can make use of it.  If someone does want to give me a hand, then the creature we make is guaranteed to be open to eveyone.  That was always my plan, but the code was not a level I felt I could give out.  Hope no-one's pissed off cause of that.<br /><br />*pirate, yo.

		"content": "Hmm, well if you want someone to bounce ideas off feel free to get in touch with me, I've put a lot of effort into the design of my game editor so I can certainly give you a hand with that.  I'm not sure whether teaming up would be wise though, as I'm extremely stubborn in my ways and I'm coding my game editor in my own special way...which basically means it's straight C++, and since I hate using other people's libraries I'm writing my own cross platform UI as I go (it's being designed first and foremost for Linux, with the eventual intention to implement Windows support in the UI library.)  So if you did want to team up, you'd have to use my library [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-mort.gif[/img] <br /><br />Of course that only really matters if you're programming the UI, I've designed it so that each area is completely independent, so if you wanted to write a file extractor you'll only have to deal with a small part of the library for reading and writing 'streams' (the idea behind that being if you write a file extractor that takes in an input stream and produces a ton of output streams, you can feed one of those output streams into another extractor/editor/music player/etc. and effectively work on files within files within files without having to extract any of them.)<br /><br />I guess my point is rather than trying to maintain the whole thing yourself, you could split it up into smaller mostly independent chunks, and then just work on each little bit at a time - once the design is done you can always have different people working on each area without any problems."

(So it'll still be hard, but easier than writing a mod utility from the ground up)<br /><br />I assume that the \"game\" command specifies the name of the game, the \"file\" command specifies the format of an image file (with a pallete chosen from palette_table) and \"table\" describles a table of files (this one being called \"palette_table\" and containing a list of palette files).<br /><br />BTW, Are you ever going to update your sig to point to szevvy.com?

The palette is chosen from the table, yes - but only as palette_table refers to something you've defined - otherwise Wombat looks for a file with the name you've given; the palette can even be field in the file, much like width, height or any other property.<br /><br />Tables are generic; they can hold any sort of data.  The idea is that Wombat will match on fileds it has values for, and fill in the values it doesn't.  They can hold filenames, or data offsets in exes, or even XOR encryption data; this way you can seperate file formats and data.<br /><br />The basic idea I'm going for is zero code - you don't have to write any code for most game formats (except custom compresion type things).  Additionally, once you've given Wombat the format of a file, it knows how to import into it - as soon as a packed file is worked out, it's possible to mod that game format; once you work an image format out, it's possible to import any other image into it, and so on.  That's the grand idea, anyway.  I suspect that the text driver language will have about 15 commands all up, so it won't be hard to figure out.  If I pull this off, of course.----------------------<br />Support (at least partially) for 27 games!<br />Check out the progress of Wombat Game Tools [url=http://student.ci.qut.edu.au/~n4738667/index.php?section=wombatwip]here[/url]"
