I also noticed the HDD blinker on the computer stopped blinking.<br /><br />Resetting didnt help, however, i managed to run winxp under a different mode and found a file <br /><br />'VO.log' in the C Drive which contained...<br /><br />[pre] CPUID=0xbm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Bufferm_pTempYUY2Buffer[/pre]<br /><br />and it just kept going.<br /><br />Also i had Hardware acceleration on 'None' because i was recording off of Win Media Player and forgot to change it back, Could this have been the problem?"

I really don't recommend trying to fix the current install. I tried it way too many times before and all it does is keep your system running with a load of errors. It would probably be wise to back up your data, format and reinstall.<br /><br />And don't look at porn anymore. That would help. K?
