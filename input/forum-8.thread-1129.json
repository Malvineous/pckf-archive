Yes, the real returning of Keen will happen when Tom Hall gets the rights. Before that appears the Anti-Keen, horrible beast fooling most of the people to believe that Keen has returned. (And that has happened with the \"Keen\" GBC.) So, Keen should be here sooner or later!

Competition has been cropping up, though, with the Epic team's Unreal 3 engine really knocking the socks off of the industry (because of its multithreaded abilities).  <br /><br />Didn't iD have an outside company come in and help produce the content for Quake4?  I've heard the argument since Quake3 Arena came out that \"iD doesn't make games; they make tech demos for their engines,\" which is fine because it still makes them money and advances the industry--but clearly iD is not the go-to company for original ideas.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd want to see what iD as a conglomerate company entity did with the Keen idea at this point...
