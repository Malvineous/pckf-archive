It's the same with Jazz Jackrabbit, Xargon, and probably other Epic games of the time. Kinda makes it hard to collect all the different versions of the game if you can't tell which is which.<br /><br /><br /><i>Edit:</i> Actually, there's a version number in Xargon. It's on the title screen's level map, just above the top of the area shown on the title screen. <br /><br />Obviously, this means it's not ordinarily viewable, unless you switch the title screen's level map (which I've forgotten the name of) with a level map that appears in the game as a playable level.<br /><br />And the point of me typing out all of this unrelated Xargon nonsense is that maybe there is a version number somewhere on the title screen map for Jill, which can give some indication as to whether the HELPME document's version number is the same as the game's version number. And then we can be sure which version of Jill contains the Keen message."
