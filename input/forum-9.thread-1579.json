Anything that I can get lost in, enjoy for a few minutes at a time, and then put down if I need to.<br /><br />It really bothers me how long-winded a lot of RPGs have become--because it means that the old Adventure genre is getting the green light to become text-filled as well.  \"This is the tutorial level.

Modern mainstream doesn't cut it for me barringa few exceptions--the sim genre (even then there's alot of gunk to sort through) and the Myst series for example.<br /><br />Everything's so caught up on realism these days (at least in the PC Gaming realm--consoles seem to be keeping at least some of their fun factor)... there's no room left to make things really trippy like in the DOS era. And as Xky points out, many games require too much effort to just get started in.<br /><br />I miss the days where one could just start the game and right away begin playing without having to learn the ropes first. Fine, give me some cinematics to acquaint me with the storyline, but when the game starts treating me like a n00b it kinda kills the atmosphere.<br /><br />There are still so many things that can be done with oldschool concepts. Think of multiplayer side-scroller that utilises the latest 3D graphics technology (with more substance than Manhattan Project), or Death Rally with a track/vehicle editor, more upgrades, free-roaming 3D, improved LANability (more than four players for a start)...<br /><br />Yet it's all been turfed aside, seemingly in favour of two acronyms I for one am getting sick of hearing: FPS and RPG.Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />\"This is how liberty dies--with thunderous applause.\" -Padme<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"
