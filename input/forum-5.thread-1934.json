		"content": "How would this be possible?<br /><br />Traditionally, MMORPGs are created from existing franchises in which multiple \"main\" characters exist, alongside a pool of enemies which may or may not be recurring throughout the series.  <br /><br />As an example, Final Fantasy XI utilized the Job system from FF2/5/Tactics/TacticsAdvance to present players with a dozen or so different ways to play the 4 races available, while offering monsters which have been series mainstays, like Tonberries, Chocobos, Flans and Bombs.<br /><br />World of Warcraft took the existing races and abilities from Humans, Orcs, Undead, and Elves, and utilized their extant lore involving Gnomes, Trolls, Ogres, and Dragons.  <br /><br />What does Keen have to offer, in this regard?  An MMORPG needs Quests, Enemies, Town NPCs, and Sidequests.  How would you get all of this to work, when the only recurring \"Hero\" is Keen, and the only recurring \"Villian\" (albeit indirectly) is McMire? <br /><br />Yes, we have Vorticons, who have an established society.  Yes, we have the Bloogs and their relationship with the Fleex and Bips.  Yes, we have the Oracle Members of Gnosticus IV, and the creatures which roam the wilds of the Shadowlands... But all three cannot (well, should not) exist within the same game universe.  The shoddy plot of the Keen GBC game proved that.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />As much as I think it'd be fun to run around Keen-style with other people in an interactive online environment, I don't think there's enough raw CONTENT to warrant an MMORPG based in the Keeniverse.  <br /><br />IMKO a Crystal Caves MMORPG would be more interesting (and plausible)...[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/posted-pics/XkyRauhKeenLogo.png[/img]"

Hired goons.  The Fleex are the ones who designed everything; the Bloogs simply manufactured it, ruining the efficiency of the design.  The Bips are the cogs of the machinery--without them, very little technology would operate.  <br /><br />The Shikadi are by far the most advanced race--not only the capabilities of interstellar flight, like the Vorticons, but teleportation and the ability to manifest energy from their beings?  That's terrifying.  Vorticons, at least, are like humans insofar that they rely on technology (or mastery of martial arts) to do their damage.  A being made entirely from substances which are lethal to humans?  Yikes!<br /><br />Sure, each race offers unique 'abilities' and could play differently, but what would the goal/point be?  What contrived little plot would weave these different strands of lore together?  What classes or other gameplay options would be available, and why would they exist?  How do the Fighter/Ranger/Mage archetypes fit into this universe?<br /><br />There's enough in the Keen games for a skeletal layout, at best.  Everything else would be like pulling teeth, and, IMKO, would require an amount of fabrication not far from simply creating a unique MMORPG, free from the copyright-infringement and licensing issues involved with the Keeniverse.<br /><br />Just my two cents, naturally.  I'm still open to new ideas, but the core of the matter is that there's no EXISTING reason for the three primary Keen races to cross each others' paths."
