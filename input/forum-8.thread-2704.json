Young animals however don't develop these bright colours until quite a while after they're born (depending on their lifespan.)  This is so that they don't attract attention from potential mates until they're fully matured (as evolutionarily speaking, it would be a waste of energy if there was no chance of getting pregnant.  Much better to focus on a mature mate with a very high chance of pregnancy, thus resulting in the furthering of the species.)<br /><br />It is interesting to note though, that for these animals paedeophilia doesn't seem to be taboo - it's only humans that have developed this idea.<br /><br />I guess it's just easier to traumatise young humans this way compared to other animals."

The question can only be: \"Is it a crime?\"<br /><br />Now, we must decide what would make it a crime, if we are ever to decide yea or nay upon the subject.  the most obvious being \"Can a child enter into a consensual sexual relationship?\"<br /><br />Simply: No.  A child is different from a 12 year old who has hit puberty and wants to bang his teacher.  Pedophiles generally target kids from 6-11.  At the age of 6 to 11, maybe 12, and even possibly past 13; one cannot simply make a choice.  They still have blind parental trust, which seriously limits any desiscion that could constitute as consensual.  The fact is their brain scientifically cannot understand the idea behind a sexual relatioship, and more over, it could only lead to abuse from their partner.  Children are too easy to manipulate.<br /><br />So, no, I think pedophilia is wrong in every dagree ethical, too.  If someone cannot consent, then by nature it is rape.  And I do not need to enter into a discussion on why rape is wrong.<br /><br />On another note, if pedophilia is ever to be conidered as a normal, we would think this because of other sexual minorities recently being considered normal.  But homosexuality, masochism, or other such fettishes, are not quite the same thing.

New connections and pathways are always being formed, which is why we can learn new languages and motor skills, recover from strokes or absorb incredible amounts of information.

I personally do not like the later.<br /><br />*I will mention the Taiwain arguement in my closing statement*<br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /> LoG:This is superflous and irrelivent. I never said, nor ever would say, that abuse does not happen in other relationships or only happens* in pedeophilia.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />No did I suggest you did. I was merely saying that it is almost impossible to create an abusive relationship unless one of the persons involved intends abuse. You do not commit murder by making friends.<br />[hr][/quote]<br />Nor do you create friends with sex.<br /><br />Sexual intercourse is a very serious relationship, and honestly, is far beyond most childrens understanding (As I have been reiterating).<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /> LoG:In order to understand possible reprocussions of their, or others, actions, yes they would.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Really? Plenty of parents of all ages out there had squat ideas of sex and relationships, and our modern scientific through outlook is shared by around about 36% of the worlds population.<br />[hr][/quote]<br />It is not relivent whether the world excepts modern science, or what age parents are.  Mainly because the only thing you could do to stop it is:<br />A. Take any children away from \"unsuitable\" parents<br />B. Abort or euthanize the children<br /><br />Niether are high on my list of ethical legisative actions.<br /><br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /> LoG:Correct, but only past puberty. You cannot tell me a child has natural sexual feelings before puberty, because scientifically they do not.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This is both debateable and uncertain. Puberty is not a clearly defined process, it occurs over several years, and yes, it is actually possible to have sexual feelings and a sex drive before puberty. People do not become gay fonly after puberty for example, puberty is merely biological sexual development, developing the physical means to impregnate and harbour new life, almost unrelated to sex.<br />[hr][/quote]<br />Actually sex has everything to do with it, biologically.<br /><br />Sexually, I have never seen a 5 year-old who wanted to have sexual intercourse with a sexy model.  Of course, I have not accounted for every single case, but that would be superflous research.  The fact still remains, many children cannot phsycologically withstand sexual abuse, whether consensual or not.<br /><br />They are not mentally capable of responding with the same knowledge of basic right and wrong, knowledge of consiquences, ergo they are not capable of entering a fair sexual expierence.  Children are still very dependant on adults for mental, emotional, and physical support.  There is just no way the relationship would be fair.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<br />------------------------------------------------------------Log: Again, sexual pleasure is different than having simple fun. Throwing a ball is fun for a child, but having sex is fun for an adult. Age is relivent to exactly what \"fun\" is.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Indeed, but exact age, definition of fun, and the individual vary considerably. In my country, glue sniffing has increased dramatically among the 8-10 year old age group, something formerly considered to be an 'adult' pastime. Interestingly over half of all 12 year olds interviewed reported engaging in a sexual act on more than two thirds in sexual behaviour.<br />[hr][/quote]<br />Sex becomes part of your culture.  However, since it is between two individuals who do not have a physioligical advantage against the other partner, it is a reasonably fair contract.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /> LoG: Consent can only be given when an individual understands, in full, what possible reprocusions there are for that act, and are not coerced by force or mind alterations<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I accept this definition except the specifics of a 'full understanding' Many people as I've said have very little understanding of the acts they preform. Parenting is an intersting example of most participants not fully understanding the consequences and requirements. [Also, as in sexual relationships, there are many sad faliures abuses and misunderstandings.]<br />[hr][/quote]<br />I was not happy with adding the \"In full\" into the clause, however, I could not get around it (Else you could have a very broad interpretation of my statement).  I do not expect anyone to have full understanding of what they do; however, I do expect them to understand that things could happen that are not anticipated, but must also be held accountable for.<br /><br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<br />------------------------------------------------------------ LoG:Firstly, because they are not psychologically* mature, meaning they are still (Most of the time) trusting to anyone, learning about the world around them, so they cannot properly understand all of the possible repercussions that espouses sexual intercourse.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />[<b>A</b>]Are we ever psychologically mature? Our personalities are only relatively unchanging after we hit 30, [<b>B</b>] we are always learning about the world around us, [<b>C </b>] and quite frankly young children are some of the most devious and untrusting people I know.<br />[hr][/quote]<br />A. No, but we are not especially capable of making desicions at younger ages, we are still learning basic manueverabilities, no need to add sex to that list.<br />B. Exactly, and thye have even less time to learn about consiquences than someone who has reached puberty.<br />C. Again, this further proves my point that they have little understanding of consequences.<br /><br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /> LoG:Secondly, they are, like I already said, not mentally mature. Scientists have found that children's brains (at young ages) are still growing and developing. They are still quite malleable, making coersion from nearly anyone possible. Parts of their brain that affect choice are not developed either, so it is impossible that they could make a choice with full capacity.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Recent research indicates that our brains never stop regenerating, although they do stop growing. New connections and pathways are always being formed, which is why we can learn new languages and motor skills, recover from strokes or absorb incredible amounts of information. Modern society considers many children capable of making numerous decisions in everyday life, and indeed encourages them to do so so that they may have practice and become more informed about their decision making processes.<br />[hr][/quote]<br />This is also irrelivent.  Did you truly expect our brains to remain constant?  My point is that we (At that age) are not capably of fulfilling even the most liberal constraints of a fair contract.<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]<br />------------------------------------------------------------ LoG: How about we take them at age 7 and teach them how to kill people? How about we show them war before they can even read properly?<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />We do and we have. Television has taught children many things, between 6 and 16 most children will see over 250'000 murders and will be exposed to various sexual acts and pornography which is increasingly avalible and perverse.<br /><br />Child soldiers, some as young as 6 have fought for their countries, and even lead army units. Many got screwed up, but thats what war does to people. [Since both murder and war harm other who definitely do not consent to these actions, they both fall outside our debate. However, I would like a more realistic description of war taught to our children rather than the 'bang bang you're dead! Boom boom bomb the city!' crap we get spoon fed these days.]<br />[hr][/quote]<br />A fair point; however, watching and doing is a fine point that should be noted.<br /><br />As for your final paragraph, it fits perfectly with my closing statement (As I have little relivent information to add, unless you decide to add more information in your next post)<br /><br /><br />In Taiwain, as you said (As well as the Filipeanos, and many South American regions), there is subservient sexual acts performed.  It shoudl be noted that this is all cultural; we teach them it is okay, so they think it is fine.  This does not make it healthy or ethical.  Indeed, this raises a few more questions in one's mind, especially when comparing it to racism, sexism, and other ideas created by culture.<br /><br />Just because it is accepted, does not make it a correct way of thinking.  Especially when you impliment it into people's minds before they are physioligically mature enough to reject it.<br /><br />Note#1: I think we should keep quotes upto a maximum of one hierarchy, otherwise it becomes either too hardto remember what that was in repsonse to, or too cluttered<br />Note#2: Bring in something else that is relivent if you argue again, because I do not want to make another hour long post. o0<br /><br /><i> Edit: Cleaned up my quotes</i>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."
