People really like making Mods (I've never made one, to be honest), and some people really like making Fangames (That's me and my 8 attempts at Keen and Norp).   Mods need Mod help, Fangames need Fangame help.  They seem to be like two different groups.<br /><br /><br />Now, I would split that with one other forum you stated, and that's 'Random Talk'.  I'd split that into Casual Lounge and Discussion and Debate.  We have plenty of both, no need to mix the two.<br /><br />Now, I see no reason to have an 'Events forum', as you can post that on the Forum calender.  (Another nice boost of not using Ezboard.)  And you could just PM an Admin to put it up.<br /><br />We'll need, however, an Announcements forum, for Mods and Admins to post news about the site (New features, subforum changes, etc) --that ONLY staff can post in, so it won't be a big concern.<br /><br /><br />This leaves us with:<br /><br /><br />1.
