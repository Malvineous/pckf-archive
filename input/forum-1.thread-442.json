I don't understand the output the assembler gives, but I guess there are SOME people out here who do understand it.<br /><br />So, any need to try and disassemble Keen exe's (and maybe data files)?___________________<br />DaVince, Yet Another Amateur Game Creator! :P"

The modding equivalent is extracting and looking at all the graphics - you often find nice surprises like unused images, and it's interesting to discover how masked tiles work.  The same applies for the code, although you usually have to be a programmer to appreciate it [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br />If you just copy an engine and try to make it look the same, you miss all that - which is fine if you're not interested, but there are plenty of people out there who are!"

There are no commands, no function or variable name will be the same than used by those who programmed the game. That is because all that data is lost when compiling C to machine code since it is of no use. As well, the structure of the C program built from assembly can be significally different than the original source was. It depends a lot how the compiler that developers used to compile the C program to assembler, optimized, and a lot how intelligent the asm-to-C translator is.3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be.
