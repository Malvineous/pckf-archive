In fact, it was pretty day-light demo. And it was shiny too. The only thing that wasn't in my taste was that they (again) are making desert environment. So uninspired for me. I guess in Texas (where it's ID headquarter) they've got plenty of desert landscapes and their games are somewhat personification of that environment.----<br /><br />[img]http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/1923/untitled116qa.gif[/img]<br />Tough Bloogs eat princesses"
