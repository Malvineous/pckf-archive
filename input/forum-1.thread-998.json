Right now, I've clocked a perfect run (in 2 segments) at about 7 mins 30 sec, getting 6 bombs from Rhubarb Rapids and Grape Grove and then getting the other 6 bombs from Apple Acres and Spud City. I know there must be a way to dramatically speed this up by getting all 6 bombs in Spud City, but I have no idea how. I've been able to get them, but not to get back up from the secret passage. Can anybody help?<br /><br />P.S. Same for Apple Acres, but I don't think those extra 3 bombs are even physically possible to get."

It's a way of doing it on an emulator so that, if you mess up, you press rewind and try it again.<br /><br />Technically, everything you do in this game is possible... just not humanly possible. You'd need computer-like precision to do Super Mario Bros. III all in one shot. They're still cool, though."
