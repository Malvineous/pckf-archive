To me it's too simplistic, I believe for a more complex story the art should reflect it.<br /><br />I suggest an art style more akin to the more of the superhero comics (spider-man for instance) or some of the Archie Sonic comics around issues #70-80 (before they got anime-ish and before Ron Lim took over), some of the noted artists are Steven Butler and J Axer (though Axer didn't come till later).<br /><br />If that's too much, mostly what I am getting at is more detail, so I gave those examples in case you need more examples of more detailed art. <br /><br />If you like your art the way it is, I'm just throwing out some suggestions of what *might* make it better. The important thing is for you to follow your own artistic ideas. Either way I think the comic will only get better. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"

That one profile view though... where'd his snout go?<br /><br />BTW, how many pages are you expecting this to be?  At any rate, I like this latest batch of pages. Let's see what's next..."
