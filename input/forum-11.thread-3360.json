If anyone is interested in converting IMF's to MIDI files, or enhancing MIDI files from Apogee General MIDI games (like Realms or Hocus, etc), please contact me (through my website mentioned earlier).<br /><br />If I get interest, I will do easy things like record a Hocus soundtrack, or perhaps something more advanced like recording a proper Monster Bash enhanced CD (say, the original tracks then enhanced GM files of each).<br /><br />Let me know folks.<br /><br />Regards,<br />- Spike"

That does sound very interesting... there were two Hocus Pocus remixes done already... they were very good, too. It would be awesome to see a soundtrack of Hocus Pocus![hr][/quote]<br />There's many TIM games, so that's a vague kind of statement [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   My favourites are the digital audio from Toon Machine and TIM2/3 (same music).<br /><br />Anyway, back to Apogee here [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]   (You're welcome to talk TIM or anything Sierra/Dynamix at my forums, though!)<br /><br />Yeah, I checked out those Hocus Pocus remixes, and commented already [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   They're very good, although the quality of instruments the guy boasted didn't quite live up to my expectations (not that they're crappy by any means!).<br /><br />It would also be easy to make a HP soundtrack, because it's General MIDI, not Adlib IMF files. <br />[I say that because I don't really want to record IMF's cart-blanche (mono Adlib sound doesn't do it for me for casual listening).<br />Besides, you can listen to them as IMF's on your PC anyway.]<br /><br />Anyway. I will do HP sometime, for sure. Have TIM on my plate though [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  <br /><br /><br />On other games, <b>I'm very interested for someone who can edit MIDI files to edit the converted IMF-&gt;MIDI files, such as from Monster Bash.</b> I have a pretty good Apogee IMF and MIDI library, and the rewards are there- I'm not asking for personal gain (as in, do this for me so I have a nice library), but would use proper MIDI's to make quality CD-worthy soundtracks for these old scores, available to everyone for free, as I do with my site now. Ideally, I'd like to do Monster Bash, BioMenace, Duke 2, and more. (For purists, I'd probably include digital versions of original IMF's as well.)<br /><br />I think I have Cosmo's soundtrack in GM (although I need TeckWrd converted) already, just in case anyone offered to do that. I'd love BioMenace or Monster Bash though [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Regards,<br />- Spike"

		"content": "Just to answer some of the comments, like Svezzy's (you're Aussie too aren't you? [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  ) :<br /><br />Basically, my goal is to have MIDI files for Apogee game scores, some of them anyway (I don't care about Mystic Towers' music for example). But I do care about (in no particular order) Monster Bash, Cosmo, Duke2, BioMenace, especially MB and BM. (Hocus Pocus and Realms of Chaos are already GM games.)<br /><br /><br />I would use them to make CD releases on my website, mix them, make them sound nice. In an ideal world, I'd work with Batteryman and make 2 CD sets, CD1 being my mixes and the second CD being him being creative, like his MP3 remixes are.<br />But I should ask him first [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br /><br /><br />The sticking point is anyone being able to extract (proper) IMF's first (which I think is resolved these days), and also getting MIDI data that's a good representation of the IMF data.<br /><br /><br />If anyone can help me out with this, I'm always eager to listen. I'd love to make a MB or BM soundtrack.<br /><br /><br />Final point- why am I so interested in this and not working with the Adlib files? <br />Well, while I enjoy the original scores, I think they have obvious flaws and limitations that a good MIDI rendering (and subsequent mixing) would be able to overcome. I want to 'recreate' the scores with good quality instruments and make them sound as good as I can.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />- Spike"
