That was a looooong day. Before then the furthest I'd ridden at once was probably even less than 10km.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy.

		"content": "[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img]  Hiya again guys.. The start of the trip didn't went well. Yeah, I was with one guy and his girlfriend because they asked me and I had known this guy from school for years.<br />Anyways, when we were supposed to leave it took two hours from that because of allkinds of stuff. When we left the sky was gray and it rained couple of rain drops. We hoped it wouldn't start raining..<br />When we had gone ~20 km it started to rain. We moved on hoping it to end. Finally it started raining more and more, when we were about 30 km from home. We decided to turn, since it seemed the rain doesn't end, we were all wet, and guessed we couldn't probably get fire started somewhere and probably couldn't get ourselves dry in the woods where we were supposed to sleep somewhere.<br />So, we decided to turn home. It was the longest kms I have ever done.. We were all wet since the beginning, it got colder and darker as well. I was sure I would die there. Couple of times I was near to drive into some ditch.<br />Well, somehow I made it, got home and went to sauna and hot shower.<br /><br />After that, clock ~1.30 am, they called me and asked if we would go with their car. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  Well, we went there by car and I just came home. Never biking for me, again..<br /><br />Ouch, seems like a long trip Spleen!!<b>You hear in your mind: GAAARRRRRGG!</b>"

Confusing.<br /><br />Sorry to hear your biking trip didn't go too well. At least you got a hot sauna and shower when you got home. (My mum loves long, wet walks, so we regularly end up out in some desolate valley cold and soaking wet. Brrr.
