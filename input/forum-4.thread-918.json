[Although with KeenRush's levels the line between 'impossible' and 'KeenRussian' was very thin, I hope you realize I had to fight off a rabid beta tester from altering BOTH your levels KR.]<br /><br />This time around I got a lot more levels than last time, so many I had to make 5 'extra' levels on a special section of map. Tiles came in pretty thickly after the origional trickle, as well as story ideas and art. No one added any patches though, so I had to be inventive.<br /><br />As a bonus, try and guess which ONE level was constructed by me. [There are, I estimate, about 3 'impossible' levels in the mod, none is mine and none is vital, but if you finnish them, you're better than me.]A proud member of the signature stealing society<br /><br /><br />[img]http://cheston.com/pbf/PBF042BCPyroBilly.jpg[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.<br />\" -Level Lord"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   But I've completed a lot over half, though.<br /><br />My second level for that mod, the level I made yesterday, isn't possible in this mod. Since I of course hadn't any Patchwork 2 graphics and such, and of course couldn't know the sizes of enemy (and Keen) replacements, \"they\" have needed to alter my levels a bit. Well, there were some jumps that were hard but now you don't (too bad) need to do them. The levels were originally a bit harder. My second level, however, isn't possible to get through in this mod. Every single place in that level is, except this place:<br />[img]http://keengrid.net/keenrush/fix.gif[/img]<br />In original Keen 2 (where I made the level) you can jump over two tiles in that kind of place. But in this mod Keen is taller and you can't do the jump. \"They\" didn't notice to fix this. Therefore, if they are going to fix it, I suggest them to move the yellow platform one tile right (where the green arrow points in the picture).<br /><br /><b>EDIT: DON'T READ THE STUFF ABOVE!

So I bought the laptop from him, reformatted the hard-drive, spent 2 weeks trying to get the right drivers to make everything work right, gave up, and trashed the stupid thing.  Then CheesyDave says, \"Dude, my CheesyMod was on that laptop!\" ... We both forgot.  :-(  <br /><br />LevelLord, what did you base the look of \"Xky Tower\" on?
