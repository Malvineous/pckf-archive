My game uses 3 separate layers plus a block layer and a sprite layer, so there is that extra layer and the block layer still unused when editing Keen maps. If anyone would help me to identify those blocks that are used for secret passages, I could automatically put them to that extra layer.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm gonna write the opposite of the level extractor, and create a test map to see if it's that easy. There's still lot of work on the editor before it gets easy to use, but it's already easier than Ted for many of us, I guess. Not to mention that it runs on XP too [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img] <br /><br />What about editing tile images and the tile information itself? Is there a way? Because I can't extract the tile images, I simply read in the already extracted ones as tiles. I want to include them in my editor if it's legal, but I don't know if it is. Anyone can extract their own tileset easily though, with modkeen and a simple image editing program. I will tell you how if you need it.<br /><br />*EDIT* I forgot to say that I already read all layers and display them in my editor![hr]<i>The human brain is not user-friendly...</i>"
