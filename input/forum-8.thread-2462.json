		"content": "So I got bored, and just considered this for a long time.  What if someone made a Warcraft iii mod with characters from the Keen universe?  Anyone play that game?  I ended up coming up with ideas of units/buildings of several armies, including the Vorticons and Shikadi.  See what you think of this.<br /><br />Heroes<br /><br />Commander Keen<br />Defender of the Universe<br />Starting Health: 500-600<br />Ending Healh: 800-900<br />Starting Mana: 300<br />Ending Mana: 500<br />Damage: 40-50<br />Weapons: Neural stunner<br />Attacks: Land and air units<br /><br />Comments: Quick and agile, Commander Keen is an able leader of any army into battle.<br /><br />Abilities:<br />Pogo - turns the Commander into an air unit for two of every three seconds, stunning a random nearby enemy unit and dealing light damage whenever landing near enemy troops.<br />  <br />Uses mana until deactivated.<br />Upgrades: Reduce mana usage, increase damage, increase stun time.<br />Starting stats: About 10 mana/second, 10 damage, 2 second stun<br />Ending stats: About 3 mana/second, 25 damage, 5 second stun<br /><br />Flower power - Attacks a unit, turning it into a flower.<br />Upgrades: Reduce reload delay, increase stunning time.<br />Stats - 75 mana usage<br />Starting stats: About 20 second reload delay, 15 second stun<br />Ending stats: About 5 second reload delay, 25 second stun<br /><br />Intelligent Optimization (autocasting) - Increases the speed of nearby friendly units<br />Upgrades: Increase speed.<br /><br />Ankh Power - Renders the Commander invincible for thirty seconds<br />Stats - 100-140 mana usage<br /><br />(Resurrection?)<br /><br />---<br /><br /><br />Vorticons<br /><br />*All Vorticon lose their jumping capabilities at night*<br /><br />Capabilities<br />Jump<br />Damage: Gives the Vorticon a 40% probability to deal 2x damage, and a 10% probability to deal 3x damage.
