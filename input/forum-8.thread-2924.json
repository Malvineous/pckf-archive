There are commercials for various Jamster ringtones where I live, and they get played so much that I deeply loathe the song on them (which is called Crazy Frog Remix or something...). I just heard yesterday about the ringtone being released on c.d or whatever and actually taking a spot on a music chart (let along number one...). This pleases so many of my friends...<br /><br />Perhaps if the song wasn't everywhere, I wouldn't despise it so much.
