		"content": "The reason they didn't put the Green Bay logo on the helmet on the title screen was because it would of been copyright infringement. While that might be ok for Dave's little escapade, it couldn't be put in a commercial game. Notice the blast marks on the helmet are over where the \"G\" would be. <br /><br />[img]http://img104.imageshack.us/img104/3017/keen4title2ow.gif[/img]<br /><br />And in keen 1-3 there is a definite \"G\" on the side of Keen's helmet, just not the greenbay logo. In keens 4-6 it looks like there is a G but you can't tell as easily.<br /><br />On the 3D realms website, in \"A Look Back at Commander Keen\", on the third page, they quote Tom Hall as saying this: \" And he wears what I wore and had as a kid: red Converse hi-tops, jeans, Packers helmet...except his shirt was purple, 'cause that was the color left over in EGA.\" -[url=http://www.3drealms.com/keenhistory/keenhistory3.html]link[/url] So if you went by original intention it would probably have the actual Greenbay logo on both sides.<br /><br />Pretty much it's up to interpretation of weather or not you should put the \"G\" on there or not. It's kind of like which side the battery goes on the Bean with Bacon. Personally I like putting the Greenbay logo on there because it looks cool and because I am already committing copyright infringement by drawing him in the first place so it really doesn't matter anymore...-----------------------<br />\"The Adventures of Commander Keen\" issue #1: [img]http://img93.imageshack.us/img93/8904/wid1kx.png[/img]<br />\"Fat people buy lots\""
