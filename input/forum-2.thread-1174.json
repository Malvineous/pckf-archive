Knowing it was gone, and wanting to do something cool, I started making my own version. I started in the Game Maker, but just today I started porting it to a Java a-p-p-l-e-t. Of course, I have a lot to learn until I can get it ready, but when its done you'll have a lot to look forward to.<br />First off, some info...<br />The game will use keyboard (mostly the Number Pad, but probably some other keys as well). I might also make the keys and numbers work alternatively to the numpad.<br /><br />Now, the technical stuff. (EDIT: Ignore. See below.)<br /><br />Ok, how exactly do i load an image to an a-p-p-l-e-t?<br />I was told by a tutorial to use this:<br /><br />[quote]<b><i>Quote:</i></b>[hr]        Image keen;<br />keen = getImage(getCodeBase(), \"keenStand.gif&amp;quot[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img]   ;<br />g.drawImage (keen, 0, 0, this);         [hr][/quote]<br />But nothing shows up. I can get a ball to show up by putting some oval text in, but no keen. Is it a problem with the code itsself, or is the file just in the wrong place? (I have one in the folder where the source is and one in the folder where the exe is.)<br /><br />EDIT: GOT IT! It was in the wrong folder!-Genius314<br />[url=http://planetck.spatang.com]PlanetCK[/url]"
