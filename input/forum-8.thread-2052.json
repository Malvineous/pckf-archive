I'll probably resume work on it soon, but not on my Keen mods series. So, it's a pity, but I seem to have lost interest in Keening. That's right. Even having the time, I seem not to have the inspiration, so, I can do nothing but wait for it. Until then...<br /><br />Yeah, I'm still around for no reason at all. No big deal. I just want to say...<br />THE N00BS MUST DIE!!!<br /><br />OK. That's it. I'll be around daily as usual, just doing nothing productive for the community. Of course, projects such as EModKeen and I-Don't-Remember-Its-Name are still in my hard disk, waiting for inspiration.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and I have big projects with other game, not Keen, actually. That's the secondary reason I left these in the freezing pool.------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].
