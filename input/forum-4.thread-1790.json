I really like the way you use the colors in the tiles too, its very appealing to the eye.  <br /><br />I really like how you patched the Vorticon Mother into that Snail; it is the most annoyingly awesome character [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img]  <br /><br />The bad thing about your mod is that the levels are soooooo hard!  I've managed to beat many of them, but some of those jumping puzzles are incredibly hard, especially when they occur towards the end of the level. I realize Keen isn't playing with a full I.Q. but this is driving me crazy [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-deadkeenvort.gif[/img] <br /><br />All in all, great mod, I'm gonna keep trying to beat this without cheating (found the \"keenrush cheat\" on accident [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-bloody.gif[/img] )"
