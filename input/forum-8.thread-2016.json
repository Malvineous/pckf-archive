Just keep in mind that you must install g++ to be able to compile C++ programs, as gcc only does C by its own AFAIK.<br /><br />MinGW's installer offers you the possibility to select what tools you want to install.<br /><br />After that, everything should be easy if you have experience with makefiles. Just do make. I think there are even Integrated Development Environments for MinGW, but I don't recall specific names atm.<br /><br />I think you can even use it along with Visual C++ if you tweak the project settings to use a compiler other than MS's included one. IIRC that is possible.------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].

It comes with quite a decent gui as well, so you don't have to use the command line to compile your code.<br /><br />It has support for c/c++ and im sure more languages.  I used it about 4 years ago in college for a c++ course i took and it worked quite well for what i needed to do.  <br /><br />If you still want to use mingw via the command line, then i suggest you look at reading the documentation.  You can't just expect people to tell you how to use it as it does take a bit of time getting used to especially if you've never worked with command line before.<br /><br />[img]http://www.cocoanut.org/images/cocoa-forum.png[/img]<br /><font color=\"BLUE\"><br />[url=http://www.cocoanut.org]www.cocoanut.org[/url]</font>"

The installation's usually fairly straightforward, finding the files is confusing.<br /><br />I second Blue's suggestion. Grab Dev-C++. You'll have access to a nice IDE and still be able to use MinGW from the command line. Plus it has a good repository of libraries you can install fairly easily from within the program.<br /><br />Good luck."
