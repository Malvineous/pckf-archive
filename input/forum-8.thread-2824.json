That way if I wanted to play games I just restarted XP and booted into DOS instead.  I even dual booted DOS and Linux until I got an old PC just for DOS games...<br /><br />IIRC it's even automatic, provided you have a working DOS partition when you install XP.  The XP setup detects DOS and configures a boot menu at startup."
