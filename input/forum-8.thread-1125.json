It doesn't sound like an actual human scream, to me, at any rate.<br /><br />Edit: Okay, I found some more cameos / tidbits.<br /><br />1) Was that a nod to Gauntlet, having the green portal which kept spawning zombies, in the \"But they came in waves\" sequence?  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />2) One of the zombies in the crowd chasing during the 2nd \"Bad idea\" refrain looks remniscent of Monster Bash's primary zombie, albeit thicker.  Also, the bouncing head.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/><br /><br />3) Colin Mochrie zombie in the line of flame-throw'ed zombies during the \"Kick some zombie ass\" sequence--he's 2nd to last.<br /><br />There's just too much to love, here.  I like the skeleton who had stabbed itself with the pitchfork, too.  <img src=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif?ttinline=true\"/>  What's the importance of \"IGSF2D,\" the license plate?"

		"content": "1) What's Gauntlet? [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-lol.gif[/img]    I just drew a crypt, and then I wanted some kind of \"evil glow\" to be coming from within it so that the black silhouettes of the emerging undead would show up against the crypt. For evil glows, I'd overused red a lot, so I tried green as a contrast, and it looked purdy. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-love.gif[/img]   <br /><br />2) I didn't put in any blatantly copyright-infringing visuals, so if there's a Monster Bash-like monster in there, it might be a coincidence. If you mean the little guy at the front, he was just meant to be a small, hyperactive zombie. I think I saved his Flash-object with the name \"Shorty\".<br />The bouncing head is from the 3rd zombie that attacks Guy in the \"It began in slow motion\" bit. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-rollhead.gif[/img]   <br /><br />3) Wow, you noticed it was Colin. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]    Or maybe that was from the tattoo. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]   <br /><br />The skeleton on the side of the road is actually trying to pull the pitchfork OUT of himself - not that you can tell, really. But he does have another bony arm clamped in his jaws, so it obviously wasn't just a one-man fight. In my mind, a guy had had his arm bitten off  by a zombie that he was soon in the process of pitchforking (before he himself \"turned\" and staggered off in search of juicy, warm brains).

Monsters were spawned out of doorways which had a green glow just like that--and would keep spawning until you actually shot and destroyed the doorway itself.  So seeing a line of zombies pouring out of a green doorway reminded me of that.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>  Even though \"green doorway\" is rather generic--I wasn't accusing, just curious.<br /><br />The zombie I said reminded me of MB was more in the posture of his run--the larger fella behind the skeleton, in front of the cleaver-wielder.  But having written that, I suppose the 'arms-dangled' thing is just generic zombie habit, isn't it.  :P  Either way, again--not accusing, just wondering.<br /><br />Is there hidden footage beyond the \"BRAINS\" guy?"

The hunchback between the skeleton and the zombie chef doesn't remind me of Monster Bash as much as some of the other zombies do though. ^_^;<br /><br />\"The Zombie Chef\" is actually a character from the zombie musical that I wrote &amp; co-directed in 2004, [url=http://tmst.twu.net/rnd/notsd.htm]\"Night of the Singing Dead\"[/url].
