I haven't fully tested that though, so if you get noise out of your speakers after changing it let me know.<br /><br />@DaVince: The old method of playing MIDIs (starting with the early Sound Blaster cards under DOS, and then continuing on to Windows) was to play MIDI files through the OPL synth.  It's difficult to do that today, because it sounded so bad (compared to a wavetable synth) that everyone tried to avoid it.  Adplug can do it, and if you want I can post the original SB16 'play' utility that will play MIDIs in DOSBox through the OPL synth (which you can then capture to .wav or .dro)  It uses different MIDI patches to the Windows synth, so it sounds different again.<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"
