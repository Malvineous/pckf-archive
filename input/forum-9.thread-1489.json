		"content": "Sure the LCD is probably overkill, but I have an old standalone LCD the same size which is quite handy for displaying things you don't want to fill the screen up with (like notifications for incoming IM messages for starters.)<br /><br />And having two USB ports on a keyboard is hardly overkill [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img]   Even Dell keyboards have USB ports on them now, it just makes it a little easier to plug in USB flashdrives.  Of course the actual reason why I want the keyboard is because of all the extra keys, I set up a lot of shortcut keys for things I do frequently and so with a piddly little 104 key keyboard I'm always running out of keys...<br /><br />And yes, $5 is too cheap for a keyboard - you'd want to spend at least $20 and get a brand name one (like Logitech, or Microsoft) and if you can find one being sold as a \"gamer's keyboard\" there's a pretty good chance it'll let you hold down rather a lot of keys at the same time.  If in doubt, ask to try the keyboard before you buy it (just explain what you want to test for), or at the very least make sure you can return it if it doesn't work well enough.  Keyboards are one of those devices where you really do get what you pay for."

But you'll find that once you've hit your keyboard's limit, the pressing of additional keys is ignored (e.g. if you open a text editor like Notepad, hold down those ten keys and then press the letter 'A' a few times, you'll find that the 'A' normally won't appear, it'll be as if you weren't pressing the key at all.)<br /><br />Also I think this only applies to PS/2 and AT keyboards because they plug in to a special controller chip on the motherboard - while USB keyboards would still have the limit, they won't beep."
