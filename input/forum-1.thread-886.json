		"content": "@ alex, flaws - Yeah, I knew, I was just commenting on how mine is scratched (poor box =( *sniffle*), and either it, my scanner, or both, are dusty.<br /><br />The cleaning up I did on my originals was 98% done using Photoshop's healing brush; pretty easy to learn, and extremely effective.  I use the eyedropper and go pixel by pixel on the rare stubborn area that the healing brush doesn't want to fix, though.<br /><br />Did the high res scans though; I honestly haven't scanned much (ever) which is why the thought of dust JUST entered my mind.  Bleh. =/<br /><br />All are TIFFs (uncompressed, unedited), and zipped to preserve the filename.<br /><br />600dpi (65.35 MB):<br />[url=http://rapidshare.de/files/21491272/keen6-front-600dpi.zip.html]rapidshare.de/files/21491...i.zip.html[/url]<br /><br />300dpi (18.94 MB):<br />[url=http://rapidshare.de/files/21491909/keen6-front-300dpi.zip.html]rapidshare.de/files/21491...i.zip.html[/url]<br /><br />150dpi (same as the JPEGs from before, just uncompressed this time) (3.85 MB):<br />[url=http://rapidshare.de/files/21492258/keen6-front-150dpi.zip.html]rapidshare.de/files/21492...i.zip.html[/url]<br /><br />~All links are Rapidshare; will die after 30 days of no download etc etc...~<br /><br />~TIFFs can be opened/resized/cropped/converted/etc using [url=http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pierre.g/]XnView[/url]~<br /><br />Enjoy Galaxieretter, alex87, all!<br /><br />- RG"

I had a look at it, even if i did clean it up, it would look almost the same, because once you scan it too much all you get is the printing dots and so you dont really gain much quality out of it. So yeah. I think my optimized image is big enough though..."
