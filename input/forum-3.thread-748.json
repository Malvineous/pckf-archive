(Edit: I finally downloaded a BitTorrent client to try this out, only to find out I can't use it. It seems like nobody is sharing it, but maybe it's because of firewall issues, as I didn't set up this network, nor have I any idea what the client expects exactly. In other words, no idea what the song is like.)<br /><br />Apparently he likes to hear our opinions about the song, so that's a very good excuse for e-mailing somebody who added a lot to Keen's personality.<br /><br />I suppose it's a pretty decent way of asking him to try another Keenish song as well, which is my excuse for putting this in the \"Other Keen Stuff\" forum. :PRetodon8<br />Sheep happens!

I thought that would of been cool.<br /><br />The song doesn't... seem to be starting for me either. No one has the file it seems.

IM me on MSN or something. I'll give it to you.<br />Oh and I will continue to seed it too.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/New-blegd-smeeg-banner-60.png[/img][/url]"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />OK, the song is done now, and I definately recognise BP's work.<br />I was a little bit afraid if he'd make a new piece (from what I found out a while ago it seemed like he stopped composing) it'd sound somewhat alien, but it doesn't.<br />I suppose style runs deeper through people's veigns than I thought.<br />As for compatibility with Doom 3... no idea.<br />I bought the game a month ago or so for cheap, found the expansion for half that so picked it up as well, but I'm actually not even sure if my current computer will run it.Retodon8<br />Sheep happens!
