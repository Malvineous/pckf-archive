[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]  <br /><br />It also has lots of other fantasy and alien alphabets (such as Klingon, and the Futurama Alien Alphabet), so if you're into alien alphabets (as I'm sure many of you are), check it out. <br /><br />[url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/sga.htm]Omniglot - SGA and others[/url]<br /><br />There's also an alphabet called \"Gargish\" which I thought would be the SGA at first, but it turns out it's just a Gargoyle script.
