Keen was their start-up game; their killer app to get them marketshare... and Doom was their breakaway success.  By the time Doom2 was out and about, they were working on making Quake the best game they could, and with that paradigm shift, Keen's 2d gameplay would go backburner long-term.<br /><br />First it was Platform Games, then Fighting Games, and now it's FPS Games.
