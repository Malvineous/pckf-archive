It'd have the forums and wiki, and would probably have an upload system like DOSClassics. It would borrow elements from sites like KeenRush's Mod Maze and Gnosticus VII - which was a review site for mods run by allstories, in case anyone had forgotten. There'd also be a blog/news page, and a bunch of articles about level design and community history and stuff (many of which already exist, so we'd only have to find and upload them). It wouldn't even necessarily have to be on one server - I'm sure a distributed login system wouldn't be too hard to implement.<br /><br />In a sentence, it would be an archive for everything the community has ever done.<br /><br />Were I running it (not that I'm suggesting that would necessarily be a good idea), I'd register the domain for at least five years and host it with someone like [url=http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net]NearlyFreeSpeech.NET[/url], who charge by the byte and allow anyone to donate to your hosting account.
