Shading was only done for the trees mostly though.<br /><br />Anyway, hope you enjoy it as much as i do. I probably won't make another one of these becuase of the amount of time it takes, but if i find a really smooth CK engine with very close to origional physics, high-resolution, ill be more than happy to re-make all sprites and backgrounds for keens 4-6. Anyway, Merry Christmas, and don't forget to vote for me when the awards are up [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]  <br /><br />Oh by the way, if there really was a VGA keen, i don't think there would be this many colors. Alot of VGA dos games still look like slightly improved EGA versions (IMKO).<br /><br />[img]http://img458.imageshack.us/img458/6495/egakeen1ql.png[/img]<br /><br />[img]http://img385.imageshack.us/img385/9359/keen6artwork0gv.png[/img]---------<br />[img]http://img250.echo.cx/img250/9885/comicstrip9vf.gif[/img]"
