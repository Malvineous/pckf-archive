[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />Anyways, Maya can be quite complex I guess, if I've understood correctly it's one of the best tools and professionals use it. (I can be all wrong, though.) Thus, it's probably the most complex.<br /><br />I have no experience on this field, but yeah, I assume xtra can give some useful tips when stoppin' by.[url=http://www.keengrid.net/]keengrid.net[/url]"

You can't start with animation if you didn't know how to create models first."
