They are positioned so that it is very difficult to get past without touching them. However, many players figured out that you could barely jump over them without touching, thus avoiding the dialog bits that interrupt gameplay. This type of jump is sometimes called a \"Yorp-jump\", a term used to refer to similar annoyance-avoiding jumps in other games. <br /><br />[hr][/quote]<br />I thought they were Vorticon Elders?  Were there any Yorps in Commander Keen 2... Or were they talking about the metal guys in Commander Keen 1, and the 'second episode' was the error?<br /><br /><br />(Which then leads to the question of what are those weird metal things on CK1.)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."
