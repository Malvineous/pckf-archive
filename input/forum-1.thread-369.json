On the startup screen the game is identified as version 1.34, and judging by the docs, it's the version Precision Software distributed in the UK and Europe. Interesting is that most references to Apogee have been removed, and the information about Fight for Justice has been replaced with information about Goodbye, Galaxy! Anyone interested in seeing this can download it from here:<br />[url=http://cd.textfiles.com/silvercollection/disc1/APOGEE/KEEN_1.EXE]cd.textfiles.com/silverco...KEEN_1.EXE[/url]<br /><br />EDIT: Found another version, read later post"

After uncompression the filesizes are still different.<br />I haven't examined EGAHEAD.CK1, EGALATCH.CK1 and EGASPRIT.CK1, but I guess the difference has something to do with \"Copyright 1990 by Id Software\" on the title screen.<br /><br />The other files are all the same.
