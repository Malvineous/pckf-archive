		"content": "I know this movie was released quite a long time ago, but how many people here have seen it? Whilst a lot of it is biased against the right, it does have some valid points that should be thought over. (<i>Carefully</i> thought over, not \"OMFG!! DIE REPUBLICAN SCUM!!11!1! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-furious.gif[/img] \" thought over)<br /><br />Funnily enough, most of the anti-Michael Moore books are not on people's shelves, but lining the shelves of [url=http://www.overstock.com/cgi-bin/d2.cgi?PAGE=PROFRAME&PROD_ID=998048&TID=911DVD&IID=PRO:998048]bargain basement[/url] stores. Obviously there's too much competition in the field of putting Michael Moore down. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-cheeky.gif[/img] <br /><br />The main problem is that these books accuse Michael Moore of lying and twisting words. While I doubt he lied, I'm sure Moore couldn't go without a little bit of exaggeration. However, these books also twist Michael Moore's life and statements to turn his own words against him. As the sales of Fahrenheit 911 versus FahrenHype 911 show, hypocrisy gets you nowhere. (Of course, Moore already had a fan base so that doesn't count)<br /><br />Whilst the content of the film may be questioned by some, the way it is presented is hilarious. The way music and video clips are cut with the film is very well done. A good example is the scene describing how the Bin Laden family were flown out of the USA after 9/11, with the song \"We've Got To Get Out Of This Place\" by The Animals playing in the background - I laughed out loud when that starting playing. Another good example is where Moore uses his frankly rather tired \"Bin Laden - Bush/McVeigh - Clinton\" analogy; he asks the question \"What would the Republicans have said if Clinton flew Timothy McVeigh's family out of the USA?\", shortly followed by a video clip of men dressed in witch-hunt clothes shouting \"Burn him!\". Classic.
