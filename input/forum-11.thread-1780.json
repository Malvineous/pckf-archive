Not to mention most of your replies are conversational and not related to the subject.<br />As well, it's about more than posting stuff \"as fast as you wish\", it's about their content as well. We don't want to see thousand of this kind of topics in few days.<br /><br />I now say what I've thought for a while; you are either a troll or Shocks again..
