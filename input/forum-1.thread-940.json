		"content": "You are 100% correct! The song is copied directly off of \"Mars, The Bringer of War.\" \"[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets]The Planets[/url]\" isn't one song but actually a series of songs. The one you are talking about is, \"Mars, The Bringer of War,\" which is the first, and most popular, song in the series.<br /><br />I never ever made the connection until I read your post. I always thought the beginning was familiar but I couldn't place it. The beginning of the two songs are almost identical.<br /><br />Awesome connection there.-----------------------<br />[url=http://Galaxie.Spatang.com][img]http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d134/Galaxieretter/Blegdandsmeegdbanner60copy.gif[/img][/url]"

		"content": "The big difference is that the .IMF's file format can only have a certain number of notes (I believe <img src=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dexter.gif?ttinline=true\"/> playing at once; anything beyond that cuts out and is lost.  Bobby Prince explained that on his site, (which, last I checked, was down,) citing the drum track in \"Jazz Me\" (also from Keen5) as sounding unusual when heard on its own.  <br /><br />\"Mars, the Bringer of War\" is a gigantic symphonic work involving several dozens of musicians all playing at incredible volume... something that 8 little music notes sounding at once can't possibly emulate."

I remember discovering those songs when someone else commented on Mars and the Q.E.D song sounding alike a few years ago.<br /><br />Fun song, that. I wonder if there was a reason behind Bobby using the song, or if he just liked how it sounded...--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"
