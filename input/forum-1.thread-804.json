And I'm sure I missed a few obvious ones --I didn't go over the later levels in K5 very well, nor did I go over the ones from K6 very well, but I'm sure I hit almost every one.  Of the few things I know I missed, it was Gik Hit Floor, Ceilick Licks, and Orbatrix Bounce.  Otherwise, I take great pride in saying \"It's the most comprehensive Commander Keen sound library on the internet!\"<br /><br /><br />It's at my new website, [url=http://www.geocities.com/globox88/index.html?1153619609019]Fort Vorta Bella[/url]'s Downloads section.  Check it out.  I'll be adding things (Like a decent banner, LOL) as the next few days progress.  After that I'll have more exciting news to release...<br /><br /><br /><br />PS: I'll get to Dreams when I get to Dreams.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

They're not stored as sound, they're stored as instructions for the Yamaha OPL2 FM synthesizer chip present on Adlib sound cards (and cloned by many others). Your only options are:<br /><br />(1) Get an actual Adlib (an original SoundBlaster with the OPL3 would work fine as well, though the synth filters sound subtly different), a computer with an ISA slot to support it, and record off of that at unity gain straight to the line-in on a recording device sampling at about 48KHz/24bit. This will work perfectly, retaining all the stuff on the higher end that drops off at DOSBox's default sample rate, and retaining the intended nature of the stuff DOSBox messes up really bad, such as the CK:GG stun gun fire sound (which has some sweeping noise effects DOSBox seems to have trouble with), the level end jingle (which winds up horribly distorted for a couple of reasons, one being sample rate), and anything short or \"clicky\", among others.<br /><br />(2) Do what the OP did and play it through an emulated OPL2 like that present in DOSBox. This works, but doesn't sound anything like the real thing, especially not when it's rendering at 22.05KHz -- the real thing rendered at about 49.5KHz (with some internal processing stages oversampling at some hundred KHz), and the closest you can get to that on DOSBox is 48KHz (assuming your sound card can handle that without barfing or losing a lot of dynamic range). Even regardless of sample rates, the emulation is imperfect, and a lot of the more complicated effects are nothing like the way they're supposed to sound.<br /><br />Having been used to playing Commander Keen on a genuine Adlib and hearing the sound effects all bright and detailed, I have to say that DOSBox (with the mixer and opl sample rates set to at least twice the default!) does a decent job -- it's difficult to emulate the behavior of weird analog hardware like the old Yamaha synths in software. However, it's still *very* far from perfect."

I've found the latest version to be almost perfect with Keen at least (mind you, it's been a while since I've played Keen through a hardware synth, so maybe I'm just not noticing anything.)"
