		"content": "Or if you want to be *really* accurate, multiply them by 63 and then divide by 255.  I found that dividing by 4 doesn't quite give you accurate enough results sometimes.<br /><br />As to the total number of colours, there are 262,144.  Most people are familiar with 8-bits per colour (so red, green and blue can each be between 0 and 255.)  Well, VGA is the same only there are 6-bits per colour (so 0-63 instead.)  When you change the colour like this, it's actually the VGA palette you're changing, it has nothing to do with EGA.<br /><br />You can actually change the EGA palette, but then you only get 2-bits per colour (so red, green and blue each have to be between 0 and 3.)  That gives you a whopping 64 colours to choose from.<br /><br />Which, if you were curious, is why you need to change VGA colour 62 when you want to change colour 14 to something other than bright yellow.  Colour 14 is set to EGA palette entry 62, and then EGA palette entry 62 can be overridden with some VGA routines to RGB values between 0-63.<br /><br />Fascinating stuff...

Each of the full screen graphics has its own palette, so throughout the game you'll see more than 16 colours, but there are only ever 16 on the screen at one time.  They use clever ideas to make it seem like more - e.g. in the story screen with that newsreader, his shirt is the same colour as the sky in the background, and the buildings in the background are the same colour as his skin - but thanks to shading, you don't really notice it at first.<br /><br />The whole game is actually based off the Cosmo engine (which is very obviously 16 colour), so much so you could easily describe DN2 as \"Cosmo's Cosmic Adventures II\" - same map format, graphics formats, etc. with a few extra improvements over the original Cosmo.

		"content": "It's utterly amazing, I didn't think such graphics were possible. I am deeply humbled by this amazing effort.<br /><br />On experimentation, it does appear that what is required for good blending is shades of a similar hue; if you look at the palette being used in that Keen mod screenshot you can see that the reds and purples have both been integrated into a kind of yellow-brown-grey series of colors. This gives you a lot more of certain colors, allowing more subtle shading.<br /><br />And of course this has two benefits; colors next to each other that don't match, like purple and red, stand out, don't blend and show the pixels. When the contrast is reduced this gives a smoother look to the whole picture. (And a more realistic one, the human eye is unused to seeing colors in nature that don't shade subtly. The 16 color default palettes are full of contrast and this makes them seem unnatural. The palette used above has a more limited color range, as can be seen on the Keen sprite, but the range it covers is more realistic.)<br /><br />Out of interest I reverted the above shot to the original palette (Plus a few color ins to compensate, and you can see the original palette just isn't suited for those tiles at all:<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/keentestmod02.png[/img][img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Awww!
