Very bad luck -- if it indeed was an accident that the heating elements exploded on TWO tanks, letting the spiders and termites escape. It could be a quirky suicide for all I can see.<br /><br />Also, probably a bit scary for the ones living in that building, aside the horrible death that happened, some creatures could've escaped and hidden somewhere in the building.3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be.
