[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img] <br /><br />Here's a picture of Mortimer McMire that I did recently... That picture on his shirt is supposed to be this Japanese character called \"[url=http://www.chax.net/frameset.html]Gloomy Bear[/url]\" (not associated with CK, but here's the [img]http://s206.photobucket.com/albums/bb125/bt-01/?action=viewt=xgloomy.jpg[/img]) which just seemed to fit Mort's personality, but looking at it now, I'm not sure if that was such a good idea.  Maybe a more readily recognizable (and less violent) logo or something would have been better?  At any rate, here it is....<br /><br />[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb125/bt-01/CK__Mortimer_McMire_by_BT_01.jpg[/img]<br /><br />Also, here's another picture of Keen I did quite a while ago.  (Production IG is yet another anime reference).  The gun in his left hand isn't anything specific, I just wanted to make something that was really detailed and/or complex (if not entirely functional).  <br /><br />Hope you enjoy these.

My image of him is that he's the kind of character that hardly ever talks and hardly ever changes that expression... just scowls all the time... the skull was intended to add a bit more ... uh.... sinister-ness... I'll have to work on that though.  As for the shirt, I've always liked when characters had shirts with logos for some reason.  It would be a good idea to try something more than a t-shirt... what else do kids wear? .....<br /><br />Here's another one based on something I would do in the game all the time. (You did it too.  Admit it!

One more. No context for this one, just thought the idea would be funny. Though I realize now the Note box should stay Omnispeak instead of Standard Galactic.  <br /><br />The art's kind of cruddy, but it's just practice.. right?<br /><br />[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb125/bt-01/scrap-12.jpg[/img]"

I just plan on following the storyline of the games, starting with Keen's landing on Mars...

Galaxieretter, is that what yours is, or is it just server space where I'd have to make my own html pages? What's the URL?<br /><br />At any rate, no CK strips for now as I'm working on another project that I pray will be completed over the weekend, but who knows.

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]   [hr][/quote] <br />Thanks for the comments, that kind of thing is always welcome..<br /><br />As far as the neck visibility issue, I don't think it has to do with too much neck as much as too little helmet... Because considering that the helmet is supposed to belong to his older brother it probably shouldn't fit quite as snug as I draw it... [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-helmet.gif[/img]   But to be frank, it's just easier to draw that way...  Another factor is that my way of drawing the helmet makes it look less like a football helmet and more like something off a \"Spaceballs\" uniform...  Normal football helmets are more flat on the sides and do cover the neck more since they are a tad longer on the side (I think).<br /><br />That is a good observation though and considering that my character designs are still evolving, I'll take it into consideration as I develop the story. <br /><br />Another thing to note is that I have to basically cut CK's helmet in half when drawing him in profile... Because if I drew the full helmet it would obscure his face... The game kind of does this too though so I don't feel too bad about it... :shrug:<br /><br />[Edit: Had to add the helmet icon because it was just so appropriate.

		"content": "As an artist I saw that you ran into the same problem I did and that is how to show emotion with only one eye. Yorps are difficult to show emotion with because you don't have eyebrows to play around with, only an eyelid.<br /><br />On a garg you can cheat because they have two eyes but a yorp has one. Believe it or not the eyebrows are an important part in a character's face. (Which is why I so prominently draw eyebrows. Eyebrows and mouth are all you need for emotion in cartoons, but I digress.)<br /><br />The next time you want to show an emotion on a yorps face draw more \"skin\" on the top. This will give you more to \"work with\" so to speak. Also, let the eye sink into the eyesocket. It helps a LOT, especially when you need a yorp to pull off a \"sly\" or \"shifty eyes\" look. Let the eye roll back while skin gets pulled over the eyes. This, more or less, is how eyes work anyway. (You probably saw on TV where people who could bug out their eyes really far from their head.) <br /><br />This works to your advantage in two ways. First off you are basing your model off of nature, the way things actually work (Just exaggerating it majorly since it is a cartoon.) and second will allow you to better use the eyelid to create emotion.<br /><br />If you want some examples to look at I suggest looking at how I draw yorps for my webcomic. <br /><br />[url=http://www.blegdandsmeeg.com/comic.php]www.blegdandsmeeg.com/comic.php[/url]<br /><br />ALSO if you want to see the same problem in a different way I highly suggest watching a few later episodes of [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBoot]Reboot[/url]. (Reboot was the first computer animated... thing to air on television. [predates Toy Story by many years] It was groundbreaking for its time and even now still raises my eyebrows.)<br /><br />(HEY COOL! They are reviving Reboot! Even a webcomic! Childhood nostalgia to the MAX!)<br /><br />Anyway, in Reboot there are many different kinds of... people. The most simple is a \"binome\". A \"Binome\" is either a 1 or a 0 shaped generic guy. (They were used as background extras pretty much.) Well the problem with the 1's is that they only have ONE EYE!<br /><br />Sounds like a yorp problem. The way they worked around not having enough eyebrows is... stunning. In season 3 Herr Doktor's (HA!) eye expressions are the best I have ever saw done with only one eye. (I want to be able to get a video clip soon... just as soon as I can figure out this video USB capture device.)<br />I found a good clip on You Tube of Reboot in which you see a lot of closeups of the \"one\" binomes and the way their eyes work. <br /><br />[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmAy0NyG6vI]www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmAy0NyG6vI[/url]<br /><br />Even if it doesn't help you I am SURE it is worth a good laugh. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-wink.gif[/img] <br /><br />I hope to GOD this helped you. I mean... it took me 3 months just to figure out WHAT I need to do in order to translate the muscles on your forehand in to a single eyelid. I have pages upon pages of smeeg eye sketches (And some mouths too.) so if you want to look at them I will gladly scan them in for you. (I just need to find the right sketchbook... I have so many. &gt;_&lt;<br /><br />Also if you have a question or want to discuss this further feel free to drop me a line. Drawing emotion, not necessarily one eyed emotion, but drawing cartoonish facial expressions is something I spent most of my teen aged years working out and my knowledge in that area is extensive. (Although I severely lack in other areas because of this, such as human anatomy.) There are a few ways to contact me. One is through this forum (Send me a Private Message) my profile (My AIM is on there.) and my Deviant Art. Not to mention I also have my email on my webcomic page.<br /><br />EXCELLENT illustrations by the way. Simply stunning. I really am enjoying this little bit of Keen fanwork.

I didn't like the design from the last strip at all..<br /><br />Another thing I appologize for is the text in the last panel.. It's wordy, small, and messy.. I played around with both the verbage and the lettering, but this is the best I came up with.. If you can't make it out let me know and I'll see if I can clear it up more..<br /><br />Anyway..

I already have a bit of a buffer going.  My philosophy about strips is that when I sit down to start drawing one I don't get up until it's complete.  Hence why I'm so often appologizing for messy art whilst not taking the time to correct said messy art.  But the schedule is as much for my own happiness as anything else, because it helps put keep everything in order.  Plus, if I didn't have that philosophy, I'll admit to you right now that I would never get anything done... ever.  And I don't write a script for a strip until I have the complete idea in my head.  All in all it helps me use my time more efficiently (in theory). <br /><br />At any rate, if I don't keep to the schedule I give you permission to verbally beat me senseless.

Nettle spikes too are silica, and the 'teeth' of venus flytraps are hardened with it. Heck, you can even identify fossil dirt by looking at what silica grains plants have left in it.

Watterson isn't<i> too </i>bad when it comes to copyright infringements, he seems to have  a healthy respect for them (After, I believe, drawing Snoopy for a school contest and being disqualified.)
