He brought back Kant, which immediately caused a 120 year long religious war and caused the arising of a new sect based apon the works of Kahn.<br /><br />Hence the martian saying 'Immanuel Kany, but Kublai Kahn.'<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
