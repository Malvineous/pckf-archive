It's logically to guess that Keen can hang and hook up on all acute-angeled breakades and climb from them to a ways, but really they behave different:<br /><br />In Keen 6 you can hang on the acute-angeled breakanes, but can' climb up (If you try to do so you will hang again!)<br />In Keen 5 behaviour of Keen on the acute-angeled breakages depend on color of wall (they can exist on red ang green walls, but not on yellow-black)!:<br />On the red walls right acute-angeled breakage doesn't exist, and left behave very strange: you can't even hang on it, not just climb up!!<br />On the green wall everything is normal: you can hang on the breakage and climb up.<br /><br />Please explain me: why these breakages behave different?[img]http://classicgaming.com/cc314/encyclopedia/images/enemyk4-wormouth.gif[/img]"

		"content": "Well, i'll try but I'm too lazy to paint some graphics and load them up...<br /><br />First off all: it has nothing to do with the style of the tiles...<br /><br />You cant hang on *ANY* slopes which go up, so if u come from left you cant hang on a slope like which goes like \"/\" and if u come from right u cant hang on a slope like \"\\\". This is because the keen-engine checks when it tries to hang keen onto an edge only for tiles which have the respective left- or right-flag set to 1 (something like solid!) AND the tile above has to have *ALL* flags (top, bottom, left, right) set to 0! So u can basicly only hang on slopes which go done if u face them. (Because on every slope, which goes upwards, the engine would assume u hang on the tile below the slope (which obviously should have set the corresponding left/right flag set to 1!) BUT the tile above isnt flat ( = topflag isnt set to 0)<br /><br />Why u drop after u climb up on an acute-angled slope I' not sure till now..<br /><br />MfG<br /><br />PS: this is a piece of code which hopefully describes what the problem is (it's for direction = left):<br /><br />[pre] if(&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp (ptile_rightflags[ (DI) ] == 0) &amp;&amp;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp (ptile_leftflags[ (DI) ] == 0) &amp;&amp;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp (ptile_topflags[ (DI) ] == 0) &amp;&amp;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp (ptile_bottomflags[ (DI) ] == 0) ) {&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp /* loc_1796 */&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp tile_pointer += level_width;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp (BX) = *tile_pointer;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp if(&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp ( ptile_rightflags[  (BX) ] != 0 ) &amp;&amp;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp ( ptile_leftflags[ (BX) ] != 0 ) ) {&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp /* loc_1798 */&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp keen-&gt;xmotion = -1;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp keen-&gt;clipping = 0;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp keen-&gt;xpos = (keen-&gt;xpos &amp; 0xFF00) + 128;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp keen-&gt;ypos = local_08  64;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp keen-&gt;int10 = 0;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp /* deltaY? */&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp keen-&gt;ymove = 0;&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp sub_305( keen, &amp;A_KEEN_HANG_0 );&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp /* 0x12EC */&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp }}[/pre]"

I will test (and maybe even fix) it now, using the utilite ck456tli. But in Keen 6 there is only color of acute-angeled breakage and this explanation don't fit. Also i found that most of the problems with breakages have been fixed in Keen 6 1.5.[img]http://classicgaming.com/cc314/encyclopedia/images/enemyk4-wormouth.gif[/img]"

The tile 847 dec ($034F hex, green acute-angeled breakage) has the left flag 1, but the tile 631 decimally ($0277 hex, red breakage) has the same flag set to 0. I changed it to 1, and now everything works normally: you can hang on the red acute-angeled breakage in the level \"Energy flow systems\"."
