		"content": "Besides the fact that id Software created both the Commander Keen and Wolfenstein games, there is a further relationship between the two main characters.  The following is an excerpt from the Official Hint Manual for Wolfenstein 3D which explains the relation:<br /><br />William Joseph Blazkowicz was born August 15, 1911, to Polish immigrants.  Blazkowicz was a top spy for the Allied Forces, receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor and other accolades for heroism.  \"B.J.,\" (as he was called by his friends) married after World War II, at age 40, to Julia Marie Peterson.  Their son, Arthur Kenneth Blazkowicz, became a television talk show personality in Milwaukee.  For show biz purposes, Arthur changed his last name to Blaze.  Arthur later married Susan Elizabeth McMichaels.  They had one son (which they named after Arthur's father), William Joseph Blazkowicz II, or as he signs his grade school homework, B. Blaze....<br /><br />So...<br /><br />William Joseph Blazkowicz II is Billy Blazes other name and his parents names are Arthur Kenneth Blazkowicz and Susan Elizabeth McMichaels.<br /><br /><br />The more you know.[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-crazy.gif[/img]"

Now to come up with one for his brother...<br /><br />And what about Mort's family? I've always imagined his parents would also have M names, following the pattern of Molly and Mort. I  think in all the fanfictions that I never bothered to finish (maybe only a paragraph or two), I named his father Michael. I don't know about his mother, though. I could've sworn I named her something, I just can't remember what.<br /><br />Um... yeah.

It either just means they have a son (and possibly more kids too) or then iD has just been a bit sloppy -- which I wouldn't wonder, as they had already decided to kill/stop Keen at that point, I guess. I've never really thought this text very official Keeniverse information, and indeed, in case it happens they accidentally have there that the Blazes only have one son, then I won't keep this text worth much.<br /><br />And yeah, no idea about Mort's family. Michael wouldn't be a bad name..3D Realms: \"Do you think there'll ever be a sequel to your game(s)?\"<br /><b>Tom Hall</b>: \"<i>If</i> I owned Keen, there sure would be.
