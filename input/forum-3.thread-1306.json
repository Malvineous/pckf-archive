		"content": "This was mentioned during the topic about my remixes, but I think it should be semi-officially announced now. The basic idea is to remix every BGM track from Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate my Babysitter.<br /><br />It'll to be somewhat like the Patchwork Mods, with each participating member contributing a remix (or more than one if they want to) until all the tracks have been remixed. If you want to contribute, please either post in this topic or email me, and tell me which track you want to remix (to try and avoid having more than one person remix the same track).<br /><br />I'll put who's doing which track on this list:<br /><br /><b>Commander Keen: Secret of the Oracle</b><br /><br />Just Another Kick in The Pants in Good Old Hillville - <br />Too Hot! - ElecDude33 (finished)<br />Eat Your Veggies - <br />Slug Village - <br />Shadowlands -<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Commander Keen: The Armageddon Machine</b><br /><br />Be Spereful With My Diamonds -<br />Jazz Me -<br />Make it Tighter - <br />Security Center - <br />Wednesday on the Beach -<br />The Armageddon Machine -<br />Quantum Explosion Dynamo -<br />Gravitational Damping Hub -<br />Korath Fling (?) -<br />Game Over - <br />High Score Table -<br /><br /><b>Commander Keen: Aliens Ate My Babysitter</b><br /><br />Aliens Ate my Babysitter - <br />Mamba Snake - <br />To the Future -<br />Eat at Joe's - <br />Guard Posts - <br />Bloogwater Crossing -<br />Bloogton Manufacturing - <br />Bloog Control Centre -<br />Bean With Bacon Megarocket/High Score Table -<br /><br />(note: I might have missed some tracks or made some mistakes.

A lot of people (like me) don't want unnecessary plugins or downloads cluttering up their hard drive and or registry.
