It's also handy for receiving calls from friends and clients, as well as talking to my girlfriend.<br /><br />It amuses me how often other people seem to be without credit  when they really don't do much more with their phones than I do. $30 has lasted me well over two months.<br /><br />Messages cost me 1c each to other Telstra phones; calls cost 35c for ten minutes after 9pm, but I'm also given 5c/minute for incoming calls, which means we each end up with 15c more after a 20 minute call.<br /><br />I must acquire a new one sometime, though. The keypad on this one is starting to become unresponsive, so I keep having to either press really hard for some buttons or pull the phone apart and use a toothpick. Takes me ages to write a message with this thing, whereas on a working phone I can touchtype and punch out a message in no time.<br /><br />Once I setup this wireless network across town, hopefully I'll be able to get some handheld devices to communicate across it, removing the need to use a phone at all unless I'm abroad."

I'm still too stingy to pay for a mobile phone call when there's an alternative that I'm not paying the bill for."
