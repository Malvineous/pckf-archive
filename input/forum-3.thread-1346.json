		"content": "Hey all, I know its been a while<br /><br />To tell the truth its all gone a bit tits-up. The main actor decided to have a row with us all and left. That means that shooting has been pushed back to Jan / Feb as its totally fecked up the schedule.<br /><br />Also we have decided to just make one film combining all three episodes, it was too ambitious to go for the trilogy. It would have taken probably a year to get all the fx and post done let alone filming the bugger!<br /><br />However I do have some good news, as mentioned before I am being a bit experimental in doing the music and graphics alongside the filming process. This is so everyone has some idea to the feel of the film and it wont take 90 gazillion billion years to complete.<br /><br />I tried to do the website but I can't log on to it [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-sad.gif[/img]  A friend has decided to lend me some space so expect a website at [url=http://ckmovie.sky-network.net/]ckmovie.sky-network.net/[/url] anytime soon.<br /><br />If you head there now however, you can checkout an update on the FX work and two songs which have been drafted. keen_beach is the music for a scene where keen has been shot-down on approach to a base. It is set on a beach (because there are lots of those around in England :P )<br /><br />The other track is just a montage to get the overall mood of the film. This is the best representation really, as I wanted the film to be sort of dark and rocky.<br /><br />Anyway enjoy, I promise the movie will be done!<br /><br />as always you can contact me at mat.larsen {at} gmail.com"

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-surprise.gif[/img]  Awesome interpretation of Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket (I think it's B-w-B in that pic!), and the mountains look very good too.<br /><br />And the song drafts -- sounds so awesome! [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-grin.gif[/img]  You gotta release the soundtrack of this, too, once done with the film.
