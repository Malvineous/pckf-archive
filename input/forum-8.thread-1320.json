It is possible to like something even if it does have negative consequences. Smoking for example, or fans of Hitler.<br /><br />2.) An arm can bring peace, by several routes despite being primarily defined as a war causing force. <br /><br />Firstly the threat of military retaliation may force either another army or insurgents in an area to refrain from aggresive activities; this stopped a lot of wars from both Americia and Russia [but plenty happened anyways]<br /><br />Secondly an army may be used to enforce civil obediance in a politically volitile or emergency situation. The army was expected to have a prescence in New Orleans for example.<br /><br />Thirdly an army may oppose another army and thus halt their aggressive activities. Thus peace is brought by war on another. Sometimes war is necessary; the allies attempted to avoid it at all costs before being forced to oppose the axis powers.<br /><br />A proud member of the Spleen Extinction society<br /><br />[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v410/Gannalev/rcwn.png[/img]<br /><br />\"No one should be here.\"<br />-Levellord"
