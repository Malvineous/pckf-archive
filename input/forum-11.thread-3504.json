		"content": "<b>EDIT:</b> I'll be sending the questions to Frank on August 3.<br /><br />I have made contact with the Frank Maddin, the author of Crystal Caves (and also Secret Agent and Monster Bash), and he has generously allowed me to ask him a 'bunch of questions' for my Crystal Caves website.<br /><br />Instead of just asking him questions that I have written up, I'd like to see what questions CC fans here might ask him. I'll try to include all of your questions, but I don't want to bombard Frank with pages and pages of them, so please understand if I'm not able to include them all (that is assuming there are pages and pages worth of questions, of course). <br /><br />The questions already on my list are:<br /><br />- <i>Where did the idea for Crystal Caves come from?</i><br /><br />- <i>There has been a few suspected refrences in Crystal Caves to other games, television shows and other various things. The ones that I and other Crystal Caves fans have     recognized are listed here: cc1trivia, cc2trivia, cc3trivia. Which of these are actual refrences?</i><br /><br />- <i>Were you responsible for including any of them?</i><br /><br />- <i>How much of Crystal Caves had been completed when the game moved from Micro F/X to Apogee?</i><br /><br />- <i>Were there any significant changes in the storyline/ graphics/ levels/ design ect. during the making of the game?</i><br /><br />- <i>Was there anything cut from the game that you would have liked to have seen included?</i><br /><br /><br />If you've got a question for Frank that doesn't relate to CC, feel free to ask it, too.--------------<br />[url=http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/][img]http://spikenexus.toxicsheep.com/pccw/imgs/links/pccwsml.gif[/img][/url]"
