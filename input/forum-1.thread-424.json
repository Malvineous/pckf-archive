My desktop has a real PC speaker, but I don't suppose DOSbox can send anything to it.<br /><br />Spleen's sound system truly sounds like a wonder. I remember sitting in front of a DOS machine in a pitch-black room, just me and Privateer coming through what was (at the time) a huge monitor and my almighty 2.1 speaker system. Yet it pales in comparison to his setup.<br /><br />I wish there were some way I could hook up my Gravis gamepad to my laptop. I went to all the trouble of opening it up and rewiring it to make it work again, and now I have no place to plug it in. I'd kill for a USB version, but there's no way I'm going to hack my only one. If I had a backup I'd hack it in a second.________________<br />[img]http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8498/missouriansf9.png[/img]"
