[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-christmas.gif[/img]  Could you tell about it. What Keen it was, how old you were, what it felt like, had you wished it and so on. Everything you can remember.

I played a few levels, and then I got to the top of one of the levels and I was preplexed to find Molly my Babysiter there.  I would have thought the game was longer than that...  So I got her and I then found out that they hadn't sent me the full version!!  They sent me the demo!  I eventually got the full one from the company that sent it to us and played to my hearts content."
