		"content": "Talk about can of worms... this show has been around for quite some time--I recall the question of Eric Cartman's father being raised when I was in 10th grade, which was seven years ago.  The show's gone through at least that many seasons, each with their own new (or discontinued) characters, twists, and gimmicks.  The animation has evolved from cutouts under a manually-clicked camera to integration with computer software... there's a lot to work with, here.<br /><br />I was interested in the show for a short period of time, and will watch it occasionally if it's on and I've got nothing else in mind, but I'm not an avid fan these days."

The storylines are what \"make\" South Park. It's nice to see that there are still one or two TV shows that take this aspect of scriptwriting seriously.----------<br />www.StrifeStrips.com! Woot!
