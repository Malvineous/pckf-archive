And I don't even understand what you're saying... Are you saying that Keen was on TV? When? Where? Why?

[img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smoke2.gif[/img] <br />John Carmack and John Romero may be portrayed in a movie adaptation of David Kushner's Masters of Doom.<br />Masters of Doom is a book about iD beginning, apparently focusing mostly on Doom (computer game). I haven't read that book yet.<br />What Superadammario64 said was that hopefully they talk more about Keen in the movie/document, since it's their first game and their real start. They talk very little about Keen in that book, and show him as kinda just some second character that hadn't much effect.<b>You hear in your mind: GAAARRRRRGG!</b>"
