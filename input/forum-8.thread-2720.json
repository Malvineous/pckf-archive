I'm sure that when I look back at this post tomorrow I'll be like wtf? lol<br /><br />Anyway the painkiller/anesthetic made me feel so good. They must of put like Marijuana in it or something. I want more right now so bad. I was like so high or something I feel so good.<br /><br />And yes the chipmunk effect will come lol.<br /><br />I am just so pissed that I don't have my teeth right now. (I just said that!)

October Sky is AMAZING! I don't know which is better, the book or the film. It is one of the few movies that comes close to the greatness of the novel it is based off of.
