		"content": "After years of being scared of it I've now started to paint with watercolors just for fun. I suck at it, but I might get better with time. It's fun and surprisingly much easier than \"painting\" on the computer with Painter or Photoshop, only there's no undo so I need to gain lot of experience.<br /><br />Maybe this question have been asked before, but I'd like to know if there's any of you who paints or does any art that's not on the computer. I'm mainly interested in drawing with charcoal or pastels, painting with oil, watercolor etc. The ordinary colored pencils are good tools for drawing too, but you can't make a mess with them (at least not that easily) so it's not that interesting for me at the moment."

In a general sense of art (not on the computer):<br /><br />I write stories, I do a bit of poetry, and compose music.<br /><br />I am an avarage 8th grade painter, I hate water colors though. I can draw pretty good, and have done a few charcoals (though... their not that good - I tend to make my portraits look like the subject was through a coal mine immediatly before they posed)<br /><br />I have a friend named Tim. He is an awesome poet, and writes the words to some of my songs (BTW - I play the piano, and have an awesome keyboard I have hooked up to my PC), he actually practices drawing, and paiting. Right now, he's duplicating a peice of art for art class in impressionistic style. I chose a landscape, which had a blue sky, and green grass. I used only 2 colors; blue, and green. Wham; as easy as painting plywood; though not a Monet. He is doing a more complicated picture, and is putting Renoir to shame.<br /><br />I may not... but then I ask Tim's help. We make a good team, because we have different skills we fuse togather, and can make something really cool out of it; like a song.<br /><br />-- NAJAWA --"
