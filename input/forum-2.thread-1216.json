This game will continue the saga several years into the future as Keen's sister, Becky Blaze, goes off to find what has become of her brother.<br /><br />So far, I only have two screenshots to offer, and of a test level at that. But this should give you a good idea of what's coming.<br /><br />This first screenshot is of the beginning of the level. It features such visual items such as trees and grass and water. Hopefully the real levels will be more interesting to look at.<br />[img]http://www.spatang.com/gnosticus/KEEN101.GIF[/img]<br /><br />This next part of the level was set up to show some of the collectible items and how they will look with different lighting.<br /><br />[img]http://www.spatang.com/gnosticus/KEEN103.GIF[/img]<br /><br />Also, for the billionth time, here's the title screen.<br /><br />[img]http://www.yossarko.com/wdfaa/img/keensister.gif[/img]-----<br />[img]http://gnosticus.spatang.com/PBF056BCPuppyWish.jpg[/img]"

I was introduced to all sorts of platforms I didn't expect to be able to walk on, backgrounds which were awe-inspiring, and enemies which were intimidating--all without having to worry about an unfair death!  Awesome!  <br /><br />Then I hit level two, and never got past the big jump down a stairway of heat tiles.  :-(  I suck.<br /><br />I really liked your exit tiles, your Garg replacements, and Becky's shooting sprite.  The \"I'm in the air\" sprite could use a tiny bit of adjustment if you wanted to, but it's good as it is.  The Yorp replacements looked similar to your last mod's guys, if memory serves.<br /><br />Either way, excellent work so far--it looks like you've got a lot of creative ways to fool us into thinking more is happening than not.  The elevator blew my mind.  Kudos!"

Making the player literally leap through fire like that is a bit evil--took me about four tries to get that right--but it all feels rather balanced and enjoyable.

If Keen was like that I doubt there'd be much of a community either.  I think that goes for a lot of games generally - the more interesting the storyline, variety of gameplay, etc. the more likely the game will have a following.  One thing that really fascinated me with Keen when I was younger was all the secrets in it that you had to work at to discover.  I still find that sort of thing interesting - in many ways, I guess that's why I'm so interested in game editing now, at last I can use an editor to find out *all* the secrets in a game and solve the mysteries once and for all [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-smile.gif[/img]"
