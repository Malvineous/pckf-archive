Admittedly, the other FAQs title them \"False Rocks\" or \"Fake Rocks.\"  <br /><br />I could have sworn that 'Mimrock' was documented somewhere.<br /><br />Edit: HAHA~!!! I found it.  It's in the Official Hint Sheet that came with Secret of the Oracle.  The one that has the following list:<br /><br />There are seven free Keens on level 1. <br />You can get to the top of the Pyramid of the Moons. <br />We're talking the OUTSIDE. <br />There is a hidden area at the top of the Cave of the <br />Descendants. <br />Princess Lindsey appears twice. <br />In the Chasm of Chills, a slug holds a secret. <br />There's stuff hidden very well in Highville. All you need is a<br />flash of insight. <br />There's a free Keen in Miragia. <br />There's a free Keen in the Pyramid of the Ancients. <br />There's a free Keen on the Isle of Fire. <br />There are at least seven free Keens in the Pyramid of the <br />Shadows. <br />You can get to the secret pyramid by way of something in <br />the Pyramid of the Moons. Reread the Cast of Characters<br />carefully.<br />Dopefish also like to eat the small schoolfish that follow you. <br />Pressing button 1 makes you swim faster. <br />You can squash skypests by jumping on them with your <br />pogo stick while they are preening, <br /><b>You can only shoot mimrocks when they are jumping at you.</b><br />Mad Mushrooms leap higher on the third bounce."
