The core network of the grid must be accessed. The emergency system must be deactivated.<br /><b>Soren:</b> Then what do you need us for? Neo could take 'em both out easier than we could.<br /><b>Keymaker:</b> There's no time.<br /><b>Niobe:</b> Why?<br /><b>Keymaker:</b> Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed. But another connection must first be made.<br /><b>Ghost:</b> How long will that take?<br /><b>Keymaker:</b> <i>Exactly 314 seconds.</i><br /><b>Soren:</b> Just over 5 minutes.<br /><br />Considering the other numerological references (Neo/One, Trinity, 101 [binary 5, 6th including zero], 303 [sum = 6], Matrix v6) I'd say it could be an intentional allusion to Pi, and thus the cyclic nature of Zion/the One's purpose.<br /><br />Still, Keen's IQ showing up when the entire human race is once again at stake has to stand for something...Cave assectatorem Ductoris Alacris <br /><br />\"This is how liberty dies--with thunderous applause.\" -Padme<br /><br />[url=http://jimsoft.spatang.com/]JimSoft Lair[/url]"

But considering Matrix's other numbers; different primes, 101, 303, I'm sure it means Pi in that movie (or that Wachowskis are Keen fans).<br /><br />Other meaning I can think of could be 314 (circle) and 5 (well, five corners) making that pagan symbol.
