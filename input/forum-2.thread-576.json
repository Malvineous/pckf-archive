		"content": "I guess I should finally announce this project.  I haven't decided on a proper name yet, as I haven't truly fleshed out the story details yet, so I'm just calling it \"Alpha stage of Project10\".  I've been working on it since July 21st, but I won't say what I've done and what I haven't done.  Nor will I give you a story or any story specifics.  I will say that I'm treating the story with utmost dignity.  I will, however, tell you about raw details:<br /><br /><br />Zeroethly, and most importantly, this is <b>not</b> Keen &amp; Norp.  Though heavily influenced by that game idea, this is not the same game.  (IE: You will not play as Norp, and I am using the name \"Spot\" as the more canon form.)  Well, I can't rule out that you won't be playing as Spot, but it will be highly unlikely.<br /><br />Firstly, I intend to do a Newtonian mechanics physics engine.  What does this entail?  Gravity and friction forces, fluidity and bauyancy, and a few other concepts.  <b>This will be nothing seriously game-breaking</b>.  I'm doing this for my good more than your own.<br /><br />Secondly, and possibly most importantly, <i>lightly</i> 3D shaded graphics.  What does this mean?  It means that it will have much more depth to this semi-isometric (Keen 4 style) view.  It will have backdrops, tiles, etc. Also, I should note, all of these graphics will be completely original. <b>THIS DOES NOT MEAN 3D MODELING!</b><br /><br />Thirdly, there will be Advanced AI.  I really hate these stupids AI's that just walk across the screen doing the same actions, ocasionally jumping after a set timer.  My AI will be programmed to respond to Keen.  Expect this.  They might also respond to eachother; this part is still in the air.  Basically: Enemy interaction.<br /><br />Fourthly, as you all might have guessed, all original Keen 4-6, and Dreams sounds will be included in MP3 form.  Also, it will use classic Keen 4-6 music, and possibly Cosmo music if I see fit.<br /><br />Fifthly, the engine will have significant, and yet not so significant, changes in the basic engine we have grown so accustomed to in Keen 4.  This is done because I'm sick of playing the same Keen game with the same faces and same gameplay as the Keen 4 engine.  So what will it be like?  Well, it will have multi-weapons, health, basic score points, <i>no more Life Droplets</i>, and the basic Jump/Pogo/Swim features.  Hanging on edges is still up in the air.  Basically I will just say that it will be largely influenced the '93 and beyond style of games beign created by Apogee.<br /><br /><br />The main question is going to be: \"So is this still going to be Keen?\"<br /><br />The answer is quite simply: \"Yes\"<br /><br />Wait and see, I have good ideas for this game.<br /><br /><br />This is the scoop that I'm giving you guys right now.  Screens, the text story, website, and Demos will all come <i>much</i> later.  I'm treating this like Apogee is Duke Nukem Forever: 'coming: when it's done'.  I could release my story tomarrow or December of 2007.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I've changed a lot since my last time on this forum..."

(It was because I wanted to make a game like Creative Madman's CK vs GI). It has one or two glitches that i never figured out, but I made it with drag-and drop if u can believe that, and i'm just gonna start from scratch and put it into real code.<br /><br />However, i have a question for you. What keys do you use to fire a shot in your game?<br />You see, for some reason, when I hold down the up, left, and alt keys, it doesnt register and makes a beep noise after a second. This was interfering with my game, and i never figured out why jumping, moving right, and firing up would work when doing the same but moving left would not. lol.

I've even used one keyboard where a common key sequence (something like strafing to the left while firing) made the keyboard send the 'escape' keycode, so every time I tried that move the main menu would pop up...really annoying."
