Luckily, this time I have 'only' to go for the 3/5 of the time I was there previous year, since this is my last year on that high school.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-birthday.gif[/img]  I'm really happy gettin' out of that place. Too bad this year I have all the important exam stuff, the first of them in about one and a half month. I'm a bit stressed.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-garg.gif[/img] <br />Oh, and what makes it more annoying is that since my wisdom teeth from my lower jaw were taken out two days ago, I'm feeling quite annoying pain, and taking some medicine sometimes.. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dead.gif[/img]  That also has the funny effect that my face has been \"chipmunkized\"; swollen quite a bit, so my face looks like I've got about 50kg more weight (or more) during the summer..

Oh, and the reason they didn't take all my wisdom teeth is that the ones in my upper jaw are still quite deep so it would've been more difficult to get them and so on.. But they will be taken out in the future. [img]http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/msgboard/emotikeen-dead.gif[/img] <br /><br />\"You lost me there KR. What do you mean?\"<br />Well, I don't know how different the school systems are, but here we have thing called \"writings\" (freely translated), that are like exams, but a lot bigger and more important. Like in usual exam there is only stuff the course had, in these writings will be asked stuff from every course.. However, we can select the stuff that we answer, so we don't need to know about the other subjects we choose not to answer. This autumn I'm answering to history, philosophy, religion, and Swedish questions. On spring math, English, and Finnish.. (And them I'm outta there.)[url=http://www.keengrid.net/]keengrid.net[/url]"
