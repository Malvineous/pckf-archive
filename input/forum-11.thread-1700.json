In this case I changed the bytes at offset 0x172A0 from F0 E0 to E7 E8, which changes the purpose of the F10 key so that instead of showing the hints for the level, it brings up the warp cheat.  It'll have to do until I figure something more out.<br /><br />There's some curious code in the .exe to do with activating something too.  It checks the system date and will prompt for a code if the year is before 1992, and the code you have to enter in is some mathematical variation on the date (like it's the year divided by two plus the month or something.)<br /><br />I'm still not sure what that's for, but like the warp cheat it seems that there's no code to call that function either.<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"

I can disable all the cheats so far (Well, they're doubbly disabled now.) and I can remove the CODE requirement in Biomenace, but the problem is always that the keys needing pressing have some value added to them that makes them hard to locate.[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/Nevad/menbun.gif[/img]<br /><br />Awww!

I usually just ended up playing on Easy, since I couldn't get it to work.  <br /><br />...Though I did eventually beat it on Normal, too.  <img src=\"https://groups.tapatalk-cdn.com/smilies/27135/1534636883.9457-smiley.gif?ttinline=true\"/>"

		"content": "That's a point Levelass, if you're hex editing for the keys you won't see the scancodes, instead you'll see them as an offset into the keycode array (for example, the scancode for the Escape key is 1, so if the keycode array is 100 bytes away from the current location the code will check for offset 101 to see if Escape is pressed, whereas if the keycode array is 450 bytes away then the same check for the Escape key will be looking at offset 451 instead.)  I don't know how you'd be able to find keycodes if that's how you search!  (And yes, there are two memory locations in Bio Menace that store the current state of Debug mode and the Code, so setting both those to 1 will let you skip the activation procedure.)<br /><br />And that's a good point Xky - the [url=http://www.3drealms.com/cheat/monsterbash.html]official Monster Bash cheat[/url] is to hold Z first and then press F10, but nothing happens for me either when I do that...<br /><br />[edit] OH, I see - when you press Z+F10 it doesn't give you any more health, it just gives you five lives without any popup message (press space to see how many lives you've got on the status screen.)  That's a pretty useless cheat.  Still, I also discovered that M+F10 gives you free memory info and P+F10 pauses the game without displaying a message...<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"

This means you can press P+F10 on the title screen to pause it too.  Even the trainer's popups work on the title screen, only they figured out how not to make the game crash if you cancel the warp popup...or maybe my offset calculations were just off...<font color=\"#EEF2EE\">[url=http://www.shikadi.net/keenwiki/]KeenWiki[/url] | [url=http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/]ModdingWiki[/url]</font>"
