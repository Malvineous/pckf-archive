		"content": "Well, after installing openSUSE 10.2, everything went wrong.<br /><br />This, as most common Linux distributions, can resize the Windows partition during installation. To note, I did that before with the same disk and the same Windows partition some months before for installing SUSE 10.0. If you think some further historic details are necessary for my case (I guess not), ask me.<br /><br />After installing Linux, restoring data from backups of my /home under Mandriva 2007, etc., etc., decided to go back to Windows and check the disk. You know, the resize program used by the installer (ntfsresize) marks the NTFS partition as \"dirty\" so Windows automatically does CHKDSK on next boot to ensure the volume's sanity.<br /><br />And that's the point my history starts. I booted back to Windows, IN SAFE MODE. I should not have selected safe mode in Windows boot options, as it disables CHKDSK from displaying its output to screen. The only thing I know next, is that CHKDSK (?) tooked half a hour to do its duty (me staring at that black screen, unable to see CHKDSK's output), and after that, the system rebooted suddenly. Me said \"what the hell? oh, alright, just another Windows' habit\", and booted Windows in NORMAL mode. Guess what, the thing, after accessing my DVD and USB disk for no reason at all, entered graphics mode, and... the Windows logo appeared.<br /><br />Yep, the logo appeared, in that fancy logon screen. Under the logo, you usually expect a message with \"Windows is starting\" or something like that, and then the screen asking my user name and password should appear. However, this time that didn't happen. Just the logo with no text. No disk activity, no error messages, nothing. Just staring at an empty logon screen.<br /><br />The Linux kernel has something really interesting to say about this, indeed:<br /><br />Jul 19 00:20:01 blackcore kernel: NTFS volume version 3.1.<br />Jul 19 00:20:01 blackcore kernel: NTFS-fs warning (device hda2): load_system_files(): <b>Unsupported volume flags 0x4000 encountered.</b><br />Jul 19 00:20:01 blackcore kernel: NTFS-fs warning (device hda2): load_system_files(): <b>Volume has unsupported flags set.</b>  Will not be able to remount read-write.  Run chkdsk and mount in Windows.<br />Jul 19 00:20:01 blackcore kernel: NTFS-fs warning (device hda2): load_system_files(): $LogFile is not clean.  Will not be able to remount read-write.  Mount in Windows.<br /><br />The bold part appears every time the Windows partition is mounted, since that CHKDSK + reboot. No idea what \"unsupported volume flags\" means, except that it sounds really mean. Never seen such a message from the NTFS driver before.<br /><br />I need help, really. Windows if the only one who can use my printer. (And the only one who can help me to prepare a Windows port of my game engine)<br />------------------------------<br />[url=http://shadowm2006.sitesled.com/]My website[/url]<br />[url=http://p072.ezboard.com/fpubliccommanderkeenforumfrm20.showMessage?topicID=12.topic]Get Windows/Linux native LModKeen 2 with integrated FIN2BMP![/url].

That after installing the same distro (well, SuSE 10.1, I updated later, but there's not much difference in the installation anyway).<br />Btw, I did not use safe mode. You almost never need this mode for anything regarding hard disk size changes and new hardware, unless some new drivers were wrong or something.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I can help. Did you try resizing the partition in the Yast partition program? It might make Windows reinit CHKDISK and fix it all (provided you do NOT try safe mode this time).____________<br />Don't see me as an ordinary man.<br />Even though I am an ordinary man.<br /><br />Ah, [url=http://DaVince.sitesled.com/]site.[/url]<br />Oh, and [url=http://www.tengusoft.net/]Team[/url]."

However, I don't know exactly where and how to edit it. It's probably just a bit flag, not a byte value.<br /><br />Perhaps the ntfs tools package included with Suse 10.2 has a clue. Let me see this afternoon.<br /><br />BTW, I would try to use Windows setup CD, but the last time I did, it just screwed up the whole partition table.
